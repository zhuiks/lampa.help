Summary: |
  Ch. 1: The purpose and promise of the book, “The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave Him to show His slaves what must quickly take place. He sent it and signified it through His angel to His slave John, 2 who testified to God’s word and to the testimony about Jesus Christ, in all he saw. 3 The one who reads this is blessed, and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it are blessed, because the time is near!“ (1:1-3)
  John saw a vision of Jesus. Jesus told him, “write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this.” (1:19).
  Ch. 2 & 3:
  In the letter to the church of Ephesus, Jesus said that they had correctly held on to the truth and endured for His name’s sake, but that they had left their first love. He said, “Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent,” and “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in God’s paradise.” (2:5 and 7).

  In the letter to the church of Smyrna, Jesus told them to not fear that they would endure suffering for their faith. “Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer…Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. 11 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The victor will never be harmed by the second death“ (2:10-11).

  In the letter to the church of Pergamum, Jesus said that they should repent of their sin. “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor some of the hidden manna.I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.“ (2:17).

  In the letter to the church of Thyatira, Jesus said that, “I know your works—your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the first.“ (2:19). He wanted them to hold on to the truth until He came. “The one who is victorious and keeps My works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations—27 and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter; he will shatter them like pottery, just as I have received this from My Father. 28 I will also give him the morning star.“ (2:26-28).

  In the letter to the church of Sardis, Jesus said that they are dead and should repent and wake up. “In the same way, the victor will be dressed in white clothes, and I will never erase his name from the book of life but will acknowledge his name before My Father and before His angels.6 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:5-6).

  In the letter to the church of Philadelphia, Jesus said, “ I know your works. Because you have limited strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name, look, I have placed before you an open door that no one is able to close.“ (3:8). “The victor: I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God—the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God—and My new name. 13 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:12-13).

  In the letter to the church of Laodicea, Jesus said that they were neither hot nor cold and that he would vomit them out of His mouth. He called them to come to Him and to repent: “ Listen! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and have dinner with him, and he with Me.” (3:20). “The victor: I will give him the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I also won the victory and sat down with My Father on His throne.22 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:21-22).

  I believe that Jesus is coming. He is God and He is the Great King. He speaks to the churches and He speaks to me.

Thank you for Your wonderful promises.__
  Jesus promises many good things to those who overcome. How can I overcome? 2 John 5:4 says, “because whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith” __Jesus help me to trust You and live according to your Word and to walk in the Spirit. You are coming soon!
