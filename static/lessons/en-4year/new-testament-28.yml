Summary: |
  In Luke 3:15-20, John the Baptist was baptizing people and telling them about the greatness of Jesus and His works.  When he spoke about King Herod’s unrighteous deeds, Herod put John in prison. In Luke 7:18-35, while John was in prison, he sent his disciples to Jesus in order to find out if He truly was the Messiah. Jesus answered that His works show that He is the One of whom the Old Testament prophesy spoke. Jesus then said that the prophecy about John the Baptist was fulfilled: he prepared the way to Jesus. People rejected John the Baptist as well as Jesus. Mark 6:17-29 recounts how Herod killed John the Baptist. In Luke 9:7-9, Herod doesn’t understand who Jesus is and wanted to see Him. (see also Matt. 11, Isaiah 35:5-6, 40:3, 61:1, 42:1-9).
Character:
- Jesus is God

Application: |
  John the Baptist wanted to know if Jesus was the Messiah. In his understanding, the Messiah should become king, judge evildoers, save from the enemy and rule in righteousness. John was imprisoned because of the ruler’s (Herod’s) unrighteousness. He wanted to know if Jesus was The Savior that they were waiting for, who would judge their enemies and rule in righteousness. Jesus answered him that all of his works showed that He fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. He fulfilled many of the prophecies and only He could. Jesus is the Long-Awaited Savior. John didn’t understand how and when God, that is Jesus, would fulfill all the promises of Scripture (the prophecies). Jesus came the first time to fulfill the Law, to die for the sins of the world and to rise again. John the Baptist even said that Jesus is “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.” (Jn. 1:29, 36) John didn’t know that Jesus will come a second time to take to Himself all believers, to judge the world and to rule forever.
  I know that Jesus is Savior. I believe that He will return to take me to Himself, judge the world and rule forever. Now, I am waiting for His return and I want more people to know Him. I want them to be in His kingdom. I don’t want them to remain enemies of Jesus and to be punished eternally. There will always be people who don’t believe in Jesus (like Herod). These people even do evil against believers in Jesus (like Herod did to John the Baptist). But I can be sure that Jesus is the One and Only Promised Savior. I know that He blesses believers in Him and that in the end He will punish unbelievers. __Jesus, help me to tell people that you are the Promised Savior.__
