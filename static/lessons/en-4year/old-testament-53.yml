Summary: |
  Ch. 1: David heard of Saul and Jonathan’s death and mourned them.
  Ch. 2: David sought God’s will and God told him to go to Hebron in Judah, where the people there anointed him as king of Judah. He reigned for 7 years there. The armies of Judah and Israel fought but the army of David was stronger.
  Ch. 3: Abner, the commander of Saul’s army helped, so that all of Israel received David as king. But David’s army commander, Joab, deviously killed Abner. David mourned Abner.
  Ch. 4. Saul’s son, who had taken the throne, was killed and Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth fell and became crippled. The people who killed Saul’s son wanted a reward, but David punished them instead.
  Ch. 5: David officially became king of Israel. He captured the city of Jerusalem. He fought against the Philistines.
  Ch. 6: David wanted to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. But they carried it wrong and God killed the people who wanted to catch the ark when it started to fall. David was scared. Later, they carried the ark the right way, as written in the law and on the way to Jerusalem they offered sacrifices for sin. David and the people celebrated and David danced before God. His first wife (Saul’s daughter) told him that she didn’t like his behavior, but David said that he danced before God and not for people.
  Ch. 7: David wanted to build a temple for God but God said that He didn’t want David to built it. Instead, God promised to “build” David’s house so that there would always be someone from the house of David who could sit on the throne in Israel. David was thankful and worshiped God.

Character:
- Jesus is the Faithful King
- God fulfills His promises
- God loves righteousness
- He is worthy to be worshiped
Application: |
  David waited a long time for God to fulfill His promise to make him king. The Bible has many promises and I also am waiting for some of them to be fulfilled. But I am confident that God in His time will fulfill them. For example, I know that Jesus will return to reign forever. I believe that Jesus is the eternal King and I am waiting for His return. Now, He reigns in my heart.
  God promised David that there will always be someone from his family on the throne. This Word is fulfilled in Jesus. He is the eternal King and He was born from the line of David. David was a great king in Israel and humbly worshiped God. God is a great King and He is worthy of my worship. I don’t want to worship God so that others would see and think good things about me. I want to simply look to Jesus because He is worthy of praise.
  David wanted to build the temple. Maybe I want to do something nice for God to show Him that I love HIm. God doesn’t need anything but He is pleased when I express my love to Him. God showed me that He loved me when He sent Jesus to die on the cross for me. I show Him that I love Him when, through the strength of His Holy Spirit, I daily trust Him and worship Him by doing what He tells me to do in His Word .
