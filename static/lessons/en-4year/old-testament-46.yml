Summary: |
  The people of Israel fought against the Philistines. Israel lost the first battle and many people died. In the next battle, they brought the ark of the covenant and thought that it would help them to win. But the Philistines won and took the ark of the covenant. During the battle, the sons of Eli died. When Eli heard the news that the ark was captured, he fell over and died. The words of God about his household were fulfilled. Later, in the Philistine cities, wherever the ark was, people had lots of problems and sickness. God even made the statue of their false god fall over in front of the ark. The Philistines decided to send the ark back to Israel. They put it on a wagon along with gifts on the road leading to Israel.
  The Israelites were glad that the ark returned to them and worshipped God right away. Some people looked into the ark and died. Samuel led the people in sincere worship of God and they put away all their idols. When the Philistines attacked again, God protected them.
Character:
- God is sovereign (He controls everything)
- God is the only God and there are no others besides Him
- God is worthy of worship
- He is strong
- He shows that He is the only God
Application: |
  I know that nothing and no one is stronger or more important that God. God should be the most important person in my life. When I trust God (Jesus), He protects me from enemies. Jesus, help me to make you the most important person in my life. Things (money or people) can’t save me from problems. I need Jesus, who forgives my sin and changes my heart. He is with me in difficulties and guides me.
  *It’s interesting to notice that the Philistines knew about God. What did they know? See 1 Sam. 4:8 and 6:6. They knew that God was strong but they didn’t believe that He is the only God and that they should leave their idols and follow the living God. I want to follow God fully. I want to tell people that it’s not enough to know that Jesus is the Savior, but that they need to trust Him completely. He alone is worthy of worship.
