Summary: |
  Chapt. 8-9: God wanted Aaron and his family to serve Him before the people and to bring the different sacrifices for sin.
  Chapt. 10: the sons of Aaron wanted to come to God in their own way and God took their lives.
  Chapt. 11: God wanted His people to eat only clean food. He gave them a list of what they could eat and what they couldn’t  eat. God wanted them to be different from the neighboring people.
  Chapt. 16: The Day of Atonement: “This is to be a permanent statute for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month you are to practice self-denial  and do no work, both the native and the foreigner who resides among you. 30 Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the Lord. 31 It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must practice self-denial; it is a permanent statute. 32 The priest who is anointed and ordained  to serve as high priest in place of his father will make atonement. He will put on the linen garments, the holy garments, 33 and purify the most holy place. He will purify the tent of meeting and the altar and will make atonement for the priests and all the people of the assembly. 34 This is to be a permanent statute for you, to make atonement for the Israelites once a year because of all their sins.” And all this was done as the Lord commanded Moses.”(29-34).
  Chapt. 17: The people were only supposed to bring their sacrifices to the tabernacle. God didn’t want them to eat blood (v. 14).

Application: |
  God had special rules for his people and the priests when they wanted to draw near to Him. God didn’t receive those that came to Him differently than He instructed. He wanted people to come to Him by faith (Hab. 2:4 “…the righteous one will live by his faith”). Today, we can come to God only through faith in Jesus.  The law and all the sacrifices showed that sin needs to be paid for and that God is holy. Jesus fulfilled the entire law and He is holy. Jesus is my atonement. He paid for my sin, cleanses me, and makes me one with God.
  Many people in the world think that they can come to God in their own way and that if they do enough good things that God will receive them. But the Bible says that God is holy and we can’t be in His presence because of our sin. That’s why God sent Jesus to live a perfect life for us and shed His blood to cleanse us. He died for me, but He rose again and now through faith in Him, I can receive forgiveness from God. Jesus redeemed me. He was the once and for all sacrifice for me (Heb. 10:10). Thank you Jesus, for your sacrifice and victory. Cleanse me. I am thankful for your love and for all that you have done for me so that I can be  holy through You and be with You forever.
  Rom 5:10 “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life”
  *The day of Atonement in (Lev. 16:29-34) is still practiced by the Jewish people today. This holiday is called Yom Kippur.
