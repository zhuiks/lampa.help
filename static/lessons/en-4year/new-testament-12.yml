Summary: |-
  A group of people was crowding around Jesus because they wanted to hear what He was teaching. This was near the sea and Jesus asked Peter if He could teach from his boat. Afterwards, Jesus asked Peter to row farther from the shore and to throw his net into the deep waters. Peter said that they had worked all night to catch fish and hadn’t caught anything. However, Peter acted according to Jesus’ Words and threw his net into the deep. When he did, he caught so many fish that his boat started to sink! Peter fell on his knees before Jesus and said “go away from me Lord, for I am a sinner.” Jesus said “don’t fear, from now on you will be a fishers of men.”
  Peter, James and John left everything and followed after Jesus. After this, Jesus spent the night in prayer with God the Father. On the next day, Jesus called the 12 disciples who would fellowship closely with Him and follow Him.

Application: |
  Jesus did a miracle when He brought many fish into the fishermen’s net. He told the fishermen that they would be fishers of men. He meant that just as fishermen catch fish and bring them to shore, now Jesus would help them to bring people to God. Now they would tell people about Jesus so that people would come out of the meaninglessness of the world and come to Jesus for Life. I also want to tell people about Jesus, so that they wouldn’t live life their own way, but would have true life in knowing Jesus. Peter and his friends left everything to follow Jesus. Following Jesus is the most important thing. Jesus calls me to be with Him always and live every day with Him, God’s way. __Jesus, help me to know you better, to love You and to follow you every day. Make me a fisher of men and use me to bring many people into your kingdom! __
  Jesus called people to follow Him. He also calls me and others to follow Him. He promises to change us. The fisherman had caught fish, but Jesus changed them so that they started to bring people to Jesus for salvation, healing and freedom. He even gave them authority to free people from demons and heal them. Jesus also gave them a new purpose in life. I want to bring people to Jesus. He is Saviour. He also gives me His Holy Spirit to share with people about Him and to love them. He can even drive out demons and heal people using me by His Holy Spirit.
  Matthew left his work as a tax collector, where perhaps he had stolen money from people and he immediately followed Jesus. He invited people to his home to eat and fellowship with Jesus. Maybe I have done something that is not pleasing to Jesus. He calls me to leave that old life and to follow Him. If I believe in Jesus, I desire to be with Him and fellowship with Him, like Matthew. I also want to invite people to get to know Jesus. Jesus said that he came to call sinners to repentance. I know that I am a sinner that Jesus forgave and I want others to repent too and to answer Jesus’ call to follow Him.
  Some of the fishermen left their father to follow after Jesus (Mk. 1:20). Sometimes, Jesus wants me to leave my old work (like Matthew) or to leave my relatives (like James and John, the sons of Zebedee) and follow Him. This doesn’t mean that I shouldn’t work or shouldn’t respect my parents. It just means that first and foremost, I should always do what Jesus tells me to do. I want to follow Jesus. Jesus will never tell me to do something that contradicts God’s Word.
