Summary: |-
  God gave Moses a special plan for building the tabernacle (a place for worshiping God). God gave certain people special gifts and talents, so they could make everything beautiful for God’s place and to build it well. The parts of the tabernacle are: an open gate, walls around the court, the altar for sin offerings and sacrifices, the washing basin, the lampstand, the table for bread, the incense altar, the ark of the covenant inside the Holy of Holies.
  God also gave instructions about special clothing for the priests.
  see also Hebrews ch. 9 & 10

Application: |
  God gave the Israelites instructions to build a special place for worshiping Him the way that He showed them to. When I believe in Jesus, He lives in my heart and is always with me. I worship Him with my life and I don’t have to go to a special place to worship. People in the Old Testament drew near to God by faith in His mercy through offering the sacrifices He commanded. All the sacrifices point to Jesus, the perfect sacrifice for sin. I can only draw near to God through faith in Jesus, trusting His sacrifice.

  For discussion with older children:
  The Tabernacle is a picture  of Jesus, God with us (Jn 1:14).
  An open gate: all can come to God through Jesus, the door (Jn 10:7)
  Walls around the court: so that people come to God only through Jesus, the door (Jn 14:6 He is the Way)
  The altar for sin offerings and sacrifices: Jesus is our sacrifice for sin (Heb 10:12)
  The washing basin: Jesus cleanses us from sin (Heb 9:14, 1 Jn 1:7,9)
  the lampstand: Jesus is my light (Jn 8:12)
  the table for bread: Jesus is the bread of life (Jn 6:35)
  the incense altar: Jesus prays for me and intercedes for me (Heb.7:25)
  the ark of the covenant inside the Holy of Holies: Jesus is the One by whom we draw near to God the Holy of Holies (Heb 10:19)
