Summary: |-
  Gen 31-33: Jacob and his family leave Laban without saying goodbye. Laban was angry but God protected Jacob. Jacob was going back to the land where his parents were and was afraid to see his brother, Esau. At night, an angel wrestled with Jacob.  God gave him a new name (Israel) and touched his hip so that it would be weak. Jacob and Esau met and they hugged each other. Jacob and his family found a place to live and Jacob built an altar to worship God.
  Later, Rachel died while giving birth to Benjamin (35:19). Jacob had 12 sons.

  Hosea 12:3-4 “He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he struggled with God. Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him in Bethel, and there He spoke to us.”

Application: |+
  When I am afraid, I can ask Jesus for help and He helps me just like He helped Jacob when he was afraid of meeting his brother. Jacob was afraid and felt guilty because he had tricked Esau. I sometimes am afraid or feel guilty when I do something wrong. I can ask Jesus for forgiveness. God is holy and wants us to be honest. Jesus, help me to be honest and not tricky like Jacob.
  Jacob wrestled with God. He gave him a new name and touched his hip so that Jacob would never forget that God is stronger. God didn’t want Jacob to try to do things in his own strength.  Sometimes God takes away my strength so that I would depend upon His strength. Jacob started to trust God.  I can trust God. I don’t want to try to do things in my own strength. I don’t have enough strength; God always has enough strength!
