Application: |
  Jesus loves me. When things are good and when things are hard for me, Jesus is with me, cares for my needs and protects me. I can know that throughout all of my life, Jesus keeps me and that after life on earth, I will be with Jesus forever.
  God knows my thoughts. He created me and knows me even from my birth. He knows if I love Him or not. He knows when my thoughts and actions are right and when they are not right. He wants to test me (check on the condition of my heart so that I would understand if it is trusting Him) and guide me in love. Do I want God to correct and guide me? What is He showing me to do? How is the Holy Spirit speaking to me to warn me to not do something? Jesus gives me help to do what is right. __Jesus, guide my path!__
  *Ps. 113-118 were traditionally sung for Passover celebration (see Matt. 26:30)
