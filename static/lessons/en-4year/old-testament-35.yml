Summary: |
  Ch. 22-24: When Israel was traveling in the desert, king Balak saw them and was frightened. He told Balaam to curse them. God spoke to Balaam and from the beginning told him that he could not go to curse the people. Balak asked Balaam to come a second time and promised him a lot of money. During the night, God spoke to Balaam and told him that he could go with them but he could only say what God wanted and not what he wanted. In the morning, Balaam got on his donkey and went to king Balak. The donkey saw an angel with a sword ahead and started to go around him. Balaam didn’t see the angel and got mad at his donkey. The donkey wouldn’t go forward. God opened the mouth of the donkey and it spoke to Balaam! Later, God opened Balaam’s eyes and he saw the angel with the sword in the road ahead of him. The angel warned Balaam to say only the words that God told him. King Balak asked Balaam to curse Israel 3 times when they saw them from far away. But God gave Balaam words of blessing for Israel.
  Ch. 25-27: Israel sinned and started to worship the false gods of Balak. God punished them. It was Balaam’s idea to tempt the people (31:16). Moses counted the people and decided which tribe would get what land based upon their population. One man had all daughters and no sons. They also wanted to inherit land (usually it was given to the sons). They also received land. God told Moses that he would die soon, but He wanted to show Moses the promised land. God appointed Joshua to be leader after Moses.
  Ch. 28-31: God gave instructions about sacrifices for different days and celebrations. People were supposed to keep their promises (see also Lev. 5:3-6). Israel fought against the Midianites. Balaam died in the battle.
  Ch. 32: The tribes of Gad and Reuben decided to live on the east side of the Jordan river but promised to help the other tribes to fight until they all got their land. Moses remembers Israel’s journey. God wants them to kill the people that live in the promised land and destroy their false gods and places of worship to them (ch.33). Boundaries and leaders were  appointed (ch. 34). God told the Levites to live throughout the land and not in just one area. He names the cities where they will live. God also appointed cities of refuge* (ch. 35). The family of daughters who inherited the land should marry men from their tribe so that the land would remain with that tribe (ch. 36).

Application: |
  When I believe in Jesus, I belong to God and He is my help and defence (protection). Sometimes, people who don’t love God want to show that they are strong and they try to make us lower than they are. I can trust Jesus and know that He is my help and defence. He takes care of me and He sees everything that people do. Also, it’s important to not be like Balaam. He wanted to do things just to get money. He didn’t love God. Instead, he loved glory from people.
  Look again at Numbers 24:17 “I see him, but not now; I perceive him, but not near. A star will come from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel.” Do you know who this is talking about? Jesus!
  *Ch. 35 talks about cities of refuge. This is another picture of Jesus. I can “run” to Him for salvation from sin even though I deserve death. People then had to live in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only then were they free to leave the city (v.25). But Jesus is my high priest who already died (and rose again!). I am free from punishment for sin through faith in Jesus.
