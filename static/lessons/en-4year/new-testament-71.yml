Summary: |-
  Paul was glad that the Thessalonian believers were growing  in love, and in patience amidst trials by faith. They were an example of faith for other believers. At the time, they were suffering because of their faith in Jesus but the judgement day will arrive when Jesus will repay with tribulation those who trouble them. (1:6) Paul writes that nonbelievers “…shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 10 when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed.” (1:9-10)
  Paul writes about the last days because they thought that the Day of the Lord had already happened. He writes that first the antichrist will come who will call himself god and then Jesus will come and destroy him. (2:8) Paul wants the believers to stand firm in the truth that they learned (2:15). He asks the believers to pray for the going forth of the Word and for God to rescue them from evil men. He says that they should be hardworking and not lazy. (3:12)

Application: |
  I know that Jesus will return and punish those who are against Him and believers in Him. I know that then, I will be with Him forever and I will see Him face to face. I am waiting for His return! This will be a joyous day! Now I may have difficulties when unbelievers say bad things about me or treat me rudely because of my faith in Jesus. Jesus comforts me and gives me strength to continue trusting Him, to love people and to have joy in Him.
  Paul asked the Thessalonians to pray for the spreading of the Word and for protection from evil men. I also pray that more people would hear the Word and believe in Jesus. I also pray that God would protect missionaries and believers from evil men when they share the Word. Jesus, help me to not be lazy but to live for You and for Your glory every day so that many people would know You and be with You in Your Kingdom when You return.
  For unbelievers: Maybe I am not sure if Jesus saved me. What should I do? Can I be sure that Jesus forgives my sin and saves me? The Bible says that I am a sinner and that I deserve punishment for my disobedience to God. I have a broken relationship with God and I need to be reconciled with HIm. Jesus reconciles me with God. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God (He is God), who lived a perfect, sinless life and laid His life down on the cross to take my punishment upon Himself, then He will forgive me. By His mercy and grace, He saves me. I don’t trust my own righteousness (which really isn’t righteousness!) but I trust in Jesus’ righteousness and His sacrifice for me. He changes my heart and gives me new life in the knowledge of Him. He gives me the Holy Spirit who lives within me and teaches me and leads me. Jesus is in me and I am in Him! I don’t live for my own desires, but I already live by faith in Jesus Christ.
  When I trust Jesus, all of His promises are for me and I am certain that I have become a child of God. Thank you Jesus for Your great love! Thank you for forgiveness and new life in You. I love You and submit to You.
  “That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.“ Romans 10:9
  “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. “ Gal. 2:20
