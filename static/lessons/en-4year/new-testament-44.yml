Summary: |
  Jesus was near Jerusalem. He asked His disciples to get a foal of a donkey from a certain person so that Jesus could ride on it into Jerusalem. By this He fulfilled prophecy from Zech 9:9
  Matt 21:6-11: “So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:“Hosanna to the Son of David! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!”  And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?” So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”
  verses 12-22: Jesus drove the sellers out of the temple and said “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.” (v.13) The leaders in the temple were upset that children were praising Jesus when He healed people. Jesus answered that the children fulfilled God’s Word (Ps. 8:2).
  verses 23-27: The leaders wanted to know by what authority Jesus did and said these things. But they didn’t want to recognize that John the Baptist’s ministry was from God and so Jesus didn’t answer their question.

  Verses 28-32: Jesus told a parable of the 2 sons. In the end, one was obedient and one was not.

  Verses 33-45: Jesus told the parable of the vineyard and the workers who didn’t receive the master’s son when he came to the vineyard. The Pharisees heard the parable and wanted to lay hands on Jesus.

Application: |
  I believe that Jesus is God and King of kings. He is the only King who is worthy of worship. Many years before Jesus came to earth, the Holy Spirit directed the prophet Zechariah to write that the King and Saviour would come into Jerusalem on a donkey. I see that God fulfills all that He says in His Word. I can trust the Word and God. The Bible is the truth.
  People worshiped Jesus. They laid  their clothes  and palm branches on the road where He rode and cried out “Hosanna!” which means “Lord, Save!” I also can worship Jesus. I can sing songs to Him, pray to Him and thank Him for salvation. I want to give Him honor because He is worthy! People in Jerusalem heard the noise and asked “who is this?” When I praise Jesus with my life and people ask “who is this Jesus that you are talking about?” I can answer that He is the Saviour and the Eternal King! What does a king do? A good king rules over people, he takes care of them,  he makes decisions and he says what is right and wrong, he is the one in charge. Is Jesus my king?  Jesus, be the King of my life. You are my Saviour and You want to save everyone. __Thank you that You are coming again and that I will be with You in your kingdom of love. __
