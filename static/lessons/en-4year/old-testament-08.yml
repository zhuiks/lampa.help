Verse: Heb 11:8-10 “By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place

  in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; 10 for he
  waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”
Summary: |+
  God commanded Abram to go out from his land and his father’s house to a land that He would show him. He promised to make a great nation out of Abram and bless all the nations of the earth through him.  Abram was obedient to God. He came to the land of Canaan. There God revealed Himself to Abram and promised to give that land to his descendants. Abram built an altar to the Lord. Later, when there was a famine in the land (no food), Abram went to Egypt. He was afraid that the Egyptians would kill him and take his wife, Sarai. He asked her to say that she was his sister. People took Sara anyways to the house of Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) but God guarded her and struck the household of Pharaoh because he had taken her. Pharaoh returned Sarai to Abram and asked him to leave. They went up out of Egypt.
  In the land, there was not enough space for Abram and Lot’s herds to be together. Abram was older, but he allowed Lot to choose where he wanted to live. Lot chose a beautiful green place in the east. He decided to live near an evil group of people. God promised to bless Abram and give him land and many descendents. Abram worshiped God.

Application: |
  God fulfilled His promise to Abraham and He fulfills His promise to me. God promised to bless all peoples of the earth through Abraham. Jesus is a descendant of Abraham and so through faith in Jesus, God blesses me. God gave Abraham land and He gives me a place in heaven with Him. __Thank you, God, that You save me when I believe in Jesus.__
  When Abram let Lot choose the land first, he was trusting God.  I can trust God too, even when it seems that another person is getting something better than me. I can remember that knowing God is most important. It’s not worth it to chose something that looks nice but in reality is dangerous, like Lot did. Often sin looks nice but later we fall into slavery to it, like Lot did. __Jesus, thank You that You save me from sin. __
