Summary: |-
  Caesar (the Roman Emperor) ordered all people to go to their hometown to be counted. That’s why Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem (and fulfilled ancient prophecy that the Saviour would be born there). Mary gave birth to Jesus there.
  Nearby, there were shepherds watching their sheep and suddenly angels appeared in heaven and told them about the birth of the Saviour, Jesus. They found Jesus and worshipped Him. “ And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them…And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them” (Lk.2:17-18, 20).
  Later, Joseph and Mary brought the baby Jesus to the temple. There Simeon saw Jesus and spoke about how Jesus is the Saviour. The Holy Spirit had told Simeon that he wouldn’t die until he saw the Saviour. The prophetess Anna also saw Jesus in the temple and told people that Jesus would redeem Israel (Lk. 2:38).

Application: |
  Over and over again in this section of scripture it is written that Jesus is Saviour. This means that I’m in danger and I need to be saved. I am very glad that Jesus came from heaven to earth and became a man in order to save me. This is very good news!  I believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the Son of Man. I want to praise Him just like the angels praised Him. I want to worship Him just like the shepherd worshipped Him. I want to talk about how He is Saviour and Redeemer just like the shepherds, Simeon and Anna.  __Jesus, help me to praise you and tell everyone the good news that you saved me from sin and want to save everyone from their sin.__
