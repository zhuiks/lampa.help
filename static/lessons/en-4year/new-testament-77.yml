Summary: |-
  Paul wrote the letter to the Romans during the time of the third missionary journey (see Acts 20:1-3). He wanted to visit the believers in Rome so that they could encourage one another. (1:12) He wanted to preach Christ in Rome and wrote, “ For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,  for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.” (1:16-17) All people know that God exists (1:19-20). All people are sinners and need salvation. No one should judge another because we have all sinned against God and should know that, “the goodness of God leads you to repentance” (2:4) Both Jews and Gentiles need Jesus and His righteousness, “There is none righteous, no, not one;” (3:10) “But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (3:21-24)
  God is the Savior of both the Jews and the Gentiles. “For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness” (4:3) God imputed righteousness to him by faith. This was before the Law and even before the rite of circumcision. “Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, 24 but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification.” (4:23-25)

Application: |
  I know that I am a sinner and I need Jesus’ forgiveness. All people groups in all times, throughout the whole world need Jesus’ salvation. Sometimes people say, “Jesus is only the God of that people group, but not for ours.” They think that their traditions or laws will save them. Just as the Law couldn’t save the Jewish people, so then any other religion cannot save people. Jesus is the only Savior.
  I am imperfect and no one is perfect. Only Jesus, who is both God and man is perfect. He alone died and rose again and paid for my sin. He alone is righteous and can justify me and others. Abraham believed in God and it was accounted to him as righteousness. I also am justified before God through faith in Jesus. I want to trust Jesus and wait to tell people about salvation in Him. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes! __Jesus, help me to share with people that You justify all who trust in You. Help me to not be ashamed when people don’t receive the good news. Give me boldness. Lead me by the Holy Spirit.__
