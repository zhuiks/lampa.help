Book: '1 Kings 1-11: The Glorification of the Nation.  Ecclesiastes: The aspiration
  for satisfaction in Christ.'
Scripture: 1 Kings 11 and Ecclesiastes
Truth: God alone is worthy of worship
Verse: Ex. 34:14 “You are never to bow down to another god because Yahweh, being jealous
  by nature, is a jealous God.”
Summary: |
  King Solomon loved many wives from different countries and began to worship their gods. He took many wives. His heart turned from God and the Lord was angry with Solomon. He told him that he would take the kingdom away from his son. But because of God’s promise to David, his family would still reign over a part of the kingdom. God also stirred up adversaries against Solomon. This was according to God’s will.

  Ecclesiastes: Life without God is meaningless. Ecc. 12:13 “When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is: fear God and keep His commands, because this is for all humanity.”
Character:
- God is a jealous God
- God is the Living God
- God knows all hearts
- God gives meaning to life
Application: |
  God deserves to be the most important in my heart and the highest priority in my life. I can ask Jesus for help to love God more than anything and everyone. God desires for there to be one husband and one wife in a family and for both of them to believe in Jesus. Life without God is meaningless. Solomon became proud and didn’t follow his own words of wisdom. I want to always remember how great and magnificent God is, so that I would remain humble. __Lord Jesus, help me to walk with you all of my days. Thank you for your keeping power. help me to walk humbly before you. Thank you that with you, there is meaning in life now and a living hope for eternal life with you forever. Help me to tell others about hope and salvation in You, Jesus. __
