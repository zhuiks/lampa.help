Application: |
  Jesus teaches me with His Word. I know that I can be happy only when I have a humble heart and understand that I need Jesus. The blessed person understands that he himself is low and God is great. He relies upon God and not upon himself. Knowing Jesus changes my life. By His Holy Spirit, He changes what I value, how I see myself, how I see God and the world. He gives me love for God and others.
  He makes me salt and light. Salt makes things taste better and preserves them (keeps them from spoiling). Believers influence the world around them in a good way and in a certain way hinder evil. I want to be salt and light for Jesus. Jesus helps me to shine for Him by His Holy Spirit.
  I believe that Jesus is sinless and only He fulfilled the whole Law because He never sinned. This is why He could die for me on the cross and pay for my sin. This is why He rose from the dead because death could not stop Him. Now Jesus is my righteousness. He did everything right. When I believe in Him, He imputes His righteousness to me. The Pharisees  had “righteousness” from their works that doesn’t save. Through faith in Jesus, I have His righteousness, which is from God! I am saved by grace!
  His love and grace change my heart. My heart is very important to God and Jesus can change what is not right in it. Jesus helps me to reconcile with people because on the cross, He reconciled me with God. He took my sin. I can forgive others and should ask others to forgive me if I’ve offended them. When I am angry or want something that God forbids, He sees and wants me to repent and ask for help to love that which He loves. Those who don’t turn to God for help and live their own way go to hell.
  God makes our relationships right and whole. This is why He doesn’t desire people to divorce, but wants marriage to be lifelong. God wants to give us a heart that is like His heart. This is why He wants us to answer honestly, saying simply yes or no. Jesus helps me to love God, others and even my enemies. Jesus died for me when I was still a sinner. He is my example and my help in everything.
