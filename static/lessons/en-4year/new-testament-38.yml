Application: |
  Jesus wants me to come to Him. He loves me and blesses me. He receives me, when I come to Him. I can talk to Jesus and know that He hears me even when I don’t see Him. I know that He is king. I know that He showed His love when He died on the cross for my sin. He showed that He is God when He rose from the dead. He is alive and wants me to be near Him now and forever. He is near me. I can be with Jesus when I believe in Him. The Bible says that Jesus lives in my heart when I believe in Him. (Eph. 3:17, see also 2 Cor 6:16, Eph 2:22, Col. 1:27)
  Jesus has a kingdom. I can be in His kingdom when I trust Him. Being in His kingdom means that I follow Him, my King. He is the most important and I want to do what pleases Him because I love Him. How can I know what pleases Him? From the Bible! His Word teaches me about Him and His heart (what He loves). __Jesus, teach me to love You and to live close to You (to fellowship with You). Help me to know that You are the most important and that it’s worth it to follow You. Lead me. I want to follow You.__
