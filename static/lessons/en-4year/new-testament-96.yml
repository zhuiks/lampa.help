Summary: |-
  2 John
  Believers should walk in truth and love one another. Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Those who don’t believe this are deceivers. Believers should abide in the true teaching of Jesus and not receive those who teach incorrectly.

  3 John
  John wrote Gaius and was glad that he was walking in the truth. Gaius helped believers that came to him from John. They told about how Gaius loved the church and walked in the truth. These brothers traveled in order to serve the Gentiles and John wanted Gaius to receive them, that they would all be co-workers in the truth. He wrote about Diotrephes, who didn’t walk in the truth and treated those who did poorly. “Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.” (verse 11). Demetrius was an example of a person who did good. In his letters, John wrote, that he wanted to come and fellowship face to face with the believers.

Application: |
  I believe that Jesus Christ was God and man. He came in the flesh, lived a perfect life, died on the cross and on the third day rose to life. If people don’t believe in this teaching, then they are not believers in Jesus. There can be false teachers  in churches that don’t believe or teach correctly about Jesus. I shouldn’t fellowship closely with false teachers. I want to love God and believers and receive those who teach correctly about Jesus. __Jesus, help me to abide in the truth (in the Word) and walk in truth (live according to the Word). Help me by the Holy Spirit to imitate what is good (3 Jn. verse 11). Jesus, your example is the best. Teach me to love as You love!__
