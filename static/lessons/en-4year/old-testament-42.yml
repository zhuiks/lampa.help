Summary: |
  The people of Israel weren’t following God and their enemies started to oppress them. An angel of the Lord  appeared to a woman and told her that she would have a special child. This child should live according to special rules to show that he would participate in God’s special plan. This child was Samson. He grew up very strong and God gave him special strength to fight against the enemies. His strength was from God and God told him to follow special rules and to not cut his hair. Samson was often disobedient to God and didn’t follow those rules.
  A woman named  Delilah persuaded Samson to tell her the secret of his special strength that if his hair was cut, he would lose it. She betrayed him to the Philistines (the enemies) for money. When he slept, they cut his hair and he lost his strength. Samson had killed many enemies but now he was their slave in their prison. Later, his hair started to grow and he asked God to give him strength to destroy the temple he was in, where his enemies were worshiping a false god. God answered his prayer. Samson died along with his enemies.

  see also Heb 11:32-34 “And what more can I say? Time is too short for me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets, 33 who by faith …gained strength after being weak, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight.”

Application: |
  Samson did not always live the way that God wanted and fell into trouble. When I love Jesus, He can help me to love the truth and the right way. I want to follow God because He is the only one worthy of glory and He is worthy to be followed. God helps me in difficulties. God is my strength. Jesus gives me strength and joy to live in the way that He asks. The Holy Spirit helps me.
  Often in the book of Judges, it says that the Spirit of the Lord came upon a person and gave them strength to stand against the enemy (14:6). Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit for strength to tell people about salvation in Jesus, to love God and to follow Jesus and not to evil. The Holy Spirit changes my heart and gives me love for God (Rom. 5:5). __Lord Jesus, give me your strength to love you and others. __
