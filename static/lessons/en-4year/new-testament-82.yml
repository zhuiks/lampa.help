Summary: |
  The governor Felix listened to the statements of the Jews and Paul but didn’t want to make a decision about Paul’s case. Paul shared his faith in Jesus Christ, “Now as he spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and replied, “Leave for now, but when I find time I’ll call for you.” (24:25) He wanted to receive a bribe and Paul sat in prison for 2 years. Later, a new governor took over and Felix left Paul in prison to make the Jews happy.
  The new governor, Festus held another court hearing with the Jews and Paul. He wanted to make the Jews happy and send Paul to Jerusalem, but Paul wanted to stand in court before Caesar. King Agrippa was visiting Festus and Paul shared with him about Jesus. Festus said that Paul wasn’t guilty. Paul said that God sent him to the Gentiles, “to open their eyes so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that by faith in Me they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified” (26:18) Paul shared about how Jesus rose from the dead. (26:23) Agrippa also said that Paul wasn’t guilty, but because he had appealed to Caesar, he should now go to Rome.

Help me to trust You in all circumstances and see the opportunity to glorify Your name in the place where I am. You are alive and You are my life!__
