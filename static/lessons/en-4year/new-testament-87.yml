Title: To live is Christ, to die is gain
Book: 'Philippians: Joy in Christ'
Scripture: Philippians
Truth: Jesus is my joy in all circumstances
Verse: Phil. 3:8-9 “More than that, I also consider everything to be a loss in view
  of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Because of Him I have suffered
  the loss of all things and consider them filth, so that I may gain Christ 9 and
  be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but one that
  is through faith in Christ  -the righteousness from God based on faith.”
Summary: |
  (see Acts 16:11-40 about how God saved people in Philippi)
  Ch. 1: Paul wrote from prison in Rome. He took joy in the Philippians’ faith and wanted them to grow in love and to be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes from Jesus Christ. God used Paul’s imprisonment so that more people would hear about Jesus (v. 12-14). Paul lived for Jesus, so that more people would know Him but was ready to die for Jesus and  see HIm face to face (v. 21-25).

  Ch. 2: Jesus is our example in everything. He humbled Himself out of love and believers do so as well. Jesus is greater than all. Paul wanted believers to hold on to the Word of life (v. 16).

  Ch. 3: Paul warned believers about false teachings. He wanted them to believe correctly about Jesus and not to listen to those who think in a worldly way. “But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. “ (3:20-21).

  Ch. 4: “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. 5 Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; 6 do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
  8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.” (4:4-9). Paul trusted Jesus in all situations and wrote, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (4:13). He thanked the church for their help towards him and wrote, “And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (4:19).

- He is our joy
- He gives believers a heavenly dwelling

Application: |
  Paul wrote this joyful letter from prison. Because Paul was in prison, he could share the gospel with different people. He was ready to live and die for Jesus, trusting Jesus in any situation. I also want to trust Jesus when everything is going well as well as when it is difficult. Jesus suffered because of love for me. Now, He is in glory. Maybe things are difficult for me right now, but I know that one day I will be with Jesus. My citizenship is in heaven! I have a permanent place to live there with Jesus.
  Even in difficulties and suffering, I can have joy in Jesus. He gives me peace and wants me to share everything with Him and give it to Him. Jesus doesn’t want me to worry but rather wants me to trust Him in everything and even to thank Him when I pray to Him. Maybe I am not thankful for a painful situation but I can be thankful to Jesus that He is with me and He understands me and helps me.
  __Jesus, help me to think about, “whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise” (4:8). You, Jesus are true and You are honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, excellent and worthy of praise. You are my joy. Teach me to be joyful in You all the time. __
