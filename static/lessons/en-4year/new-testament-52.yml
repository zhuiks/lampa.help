Summary: |-
  Matt 28:18-20: ”And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”
  Jesus showed Himself to His disciples and explained to them that His life, death and resurrection was part of God’s plan to save the world. He told them to stay in Jerusalem until He would send them the Holy Spirit. They wanted to know when Jesus was going to be king on earth. He answered that “It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has put in His own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.” (Acts 1:7-9)
  They worshipped Him and looked at the sky. Angels told them that Jesus would return in the same way that He went up to heaven.

Application: |
  I know that Jesus is in heaven now and that He will return to be King on earth. He gives the Holy Spirit to believers so they can tell people about Him. He is always with me. He tells believers to go and make disciples (followers of Jesus) and to baptize them and to teach them Jesus’ words. Am I a disciple of Jesus? If I am, then I have the Holy Spirit and Jesus is always with me.
  __Jesus, please help me tell people that You are God, that You died for people’s sins, that You rose on the 3rd day and that You forgive our sins and give us the Holy Spirit to live God’s way and share with others about You. Help me to tell people all over the world about Your Great Love for them.__
  Jesus will return (Acts 1:11). I am waiting for that day and want people to believe in Him so they can be forgiven and be with Jesus forever. I don’t want people to be punished and be without Jesus forever.  I want them to rejoice in Jesus along with me now and when He will reign in His eternal kingdom. __Jesus, thank you that You are coming soon and even though I don’t see you now, I know that you are always with me. But one day you will return and then I’ll see you face to face.__
