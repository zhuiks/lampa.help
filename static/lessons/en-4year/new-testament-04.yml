Summary: |-
  Every year Jesus and His parents went to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover. Once, Joseph, Mary, their relatives and acquaintances had all started to journey back home and thought that Jesus was somewhere with their group traveling back. They didn’t know that Jesus had stayed in the temple.  Joseph and Mary returned to Jerusalem and searched 3 days for Jesus. They found Him in the temple where He was talking with the teachers of the law. He listened to them, asked them questions and answered their questions correctly. Mary said that they were worried and had been searching for him for a long time but He said that He should be in the place that is pleasing to His Father (verse 41). They didn’t understand Him. Jesus returned home and was obedient to His parents. He grew up wise; God and people loved Him.

Application: |
  Jesus calls God His Father because Jesus is the Son of God. Just as children are with their parents and do what their parents tell them to do, so Jesus was in the place (the temple)  where people gathered to be with God (worship Him) and hear what He told them (study the Word). In my heart, I love God and worship Him wherever I am and not just at a church gathering place. I can read the Bible to know what God is telling me. By His Holy Spirit, Jesus helps me to follow the Word.
  Jesus was obedient to His parents. He respected them. Jesus helps me to listen to my parents. Jesus called God His Father. This means that Jesus gives us an example of submitting to and listening to God. Jesus Himself is God but He came into the world to save us and was obedient to death, even death on the cross (see Phil. 2:5-11). __Jesus, help me to submit to and be obedient to You.__
