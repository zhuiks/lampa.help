Summary: |
  Ch. 19-26: Instructions about cities of refuge, about false witnesses, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth” (19:21). Laws about war. Cleansing for unsolved murders. “Cursed is anyone who hangs on a tree” (21:23). Laws about safety, purity and honesty. Laws about caring for the poor during harvest time (24:19-22). Instructions about thanksgiving and prayer to God for the firstfruits (ch. 26).
  Ch. 27-28: The words of blessing for obedience and the consequences for disobedience that they were to write and read on Mount Ebal, once they entered the land. God told them in detail what would happen to the people when they stopped trusting Him.
  Ch. 29-30: Instructions to follow after God. “Be sure there is no man, woman, clan, or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Be sure there is no root among you bearing poisonous and bitter fruit. 19 When someone hears the words of this oath, he may consider himself exempt, thinking, ‘I will have peace even though I follow my own stubborn heart.’ This will lead to the destruction of the well-watered land as well as the dry land” (29:18-19). God curses those who disobey but promises to forgive those who repent and return to Him. “I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, 20 love the Lord your God, obey Him, and remain faithful to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land the Lord swore to give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” (30:19-20).
  Ch. 31-34: Joshua  would lead the people into the land. God again and again tells the people to be brave and to not fear because He is with them. The people are instructed to read the Law together every 7 years. Moses taught the people a song that includes their history, warnings and the character of God. God told Moses that He would die soon and that He would show him the land. Moses blessed each tribe of Israel. He died and Israel mourned him.

  Ps. 90 A prayer of Moses. v. 1 “Lord, You have been our refuge in every generation. 2 Before the mountains were born, before You gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, You are God.”

Application: |
  Often in Deuteronomy, God tells the people to love Him. He also repeats that He loves them, that He chose them, that He leads them and that He is with them. I know that God loves me. He chose me and leads me and is always with me. God warns that it is dangerous to not trust Him.
  Jesus, help me to trust You and follow after You.
  Just like Moses, people die, but I am confident that I will be with God because I believe in Jesus. God gave Joshua a job to lead the people. He wants me to be brave and courageous and to trust Him just like Joshua.
  The people of Israel were ready to enter the promised land. Maybe they were scared because they didn’t know what was ahead. God comforted them and told them that a blessing was waiting for them. Jesus wants me to trust Him. He wants to lead my life. Maybe I don’t know exactly what is ahead, but I know that Jesus is faithful and that He loves me. I can trust Him. I want to follow Him.
