Title: Ananias and Sapphira and the apostles in prison
Book: 'The Gospels: The Manifestation of Christ.'
Scripture: Acts 5
Truth: The Holy Spirit testifies of the truth
Verse: Acts 5:29 “...“We ought to obey God rather than men.”
Summary: |-
  In verses 1-11, Ananias and Sapphira gave the impression that they had given all their money to the church (the group of believers) after selling their land. But the Holy Spirit showed Peter that they acted dishonestly. Ananias and Sapphira lied to God and the Lord took their lives. All the people who heard were scared.
  In verses 12-16 God healed many people through the apostles. Believers gathered near the temple and new people joined them and believed in the Lord Jesus.
  In verses 17-42 Some of the temple leaders didn’t believe in Jesus and were envious of the apostles and put them in prison. But God sent an angel at night to open the prison door and tell them, “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.” (v. 20) They went to the temple and started teaching people about Jesus. When the leaders sent for them in prison, the apostles weren’t there, although the doors were locked! They found them in the temple and took them again. Peter shared about Jesus with them but they wanted to kill them. However, one wise teacher said that if their teaching was from God, then is wasn’t worth it to stand against them but if it wasn’t from God, that in time, it would all come to an end. Then the leaders ordered that the apostles be beaten and let them go, forbidding them to teach people about Jesus. “So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His  name. 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.” (v. 41-42)

Application: |
  Ananias and Sapphira wanted to hide the truth and give the impression that they were generous. God showed everyone that it is impossible to trick God. God knows everything that I do. I don’t want to hide anything from God. __Jesus, help me to be honest.__
  The believers gathers in a place where everyone could see them and join them, so that they could be healed, hear about Jesus and fellowship with believers. I don’t want to hide my faith in Jesus but I want to fellowship with people about Him, so that they would also be joined to the Lord.
  The leaders put believers in prison because of envy! They wanted people to respect them and didn’t want Jesus to be glorified. They wanted to stop the work of God, but they couldn’t. Maybe the apostles were afraid when they were in prison but God was with them and helped them. When the angel freed them, they didn’t run home to hide. They were obedient to God and went to the temple to teach about Jesus. The Holy Spirit gave them boldness and wisdom. When people threaten me for my faith in Jesus, I can ask for help knowing that the Holy Spirit (God) will give me the necessary words and guide me. __Jesus, help me to share with people about You. Fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to not fear people but to respect and love You more than everything and everyone!__
