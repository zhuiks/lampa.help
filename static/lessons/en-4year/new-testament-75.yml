Scripture: 2 Cor. 1-7
Truth: Jesus renews us
Verse: 2 Cor. 1:3-4 “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father
  of mercies and God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our tribulation, that
  we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which
  we ourselves are comforted by God.”  or 2 Cor. 5:17 “Therefore, if anyone is in
  Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have
  become new.”
Summary: |-
  Paul writes that the God of all comforts, comforts believers in their sufferings so that they can comfort other believers. (1:3-4) He told the church to forgive and love the repentant person who had sinned earlier. (2:7-8) God enables believers to live for Him and share the gospel. “ Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (3:17-18) We preach Christ. People in the world are blind and can’t “see” Jesus, but God can open their eyes, that they would see Jesus’ glory. (4:6) We are weak vessels but the Holy Spirit is within us. “ Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 18 while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” (4:16-18)
  Our bodies are temporal now but God is preparing a dwelling for us in heaven. (5:1) One day, believers will be with Him. We want to tell others about Jesus. “ For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.” (5:14-15) Believers are a new creation. (5:17)
  Believers have the ministry of reconciliation which means sharing with people about Jesus. “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (5:21) Paul writes that believers are the temple of the living God and shouldn’t “Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?” (6:14)
  In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the believers there. They were sad and repented. “For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.” (7:10) Titus was in Corinth and told Paul how the church there obeyed his correction. Paul was very glad that they humbled themselves before God.

Application: |
  When I’m having a hard time, I know that Jesus is with me. He Himself suffered and understands when I suffer. He comforts me and then I can comfort others when they suffer. Earlier, Paul had written the church so that they wouldn’t  have close fellowship with people who called themselves believers but were really living a sinful lifestyle. According to Paul’s words in this letter, I understand that this person repented. Paul writes that the church should love and forgive this person. I should do the same. Jesus changes me so that I would become more like HIm. Thank you, Jesus, for Your work in my life and the lives of other believers. Thank you, that I am a new creation in Jesus. When a person sincerely trusts Jesus, God changes him. Do I see that God has changed my heart? Do I want God to change my heart, so that I would become more like Jesus? I can ask Him and He will work in my heart by the Holy Spirit.
  I am a weak vessel, but Jesus can use my life, so that people would be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. I can be Jesus’ ambassador. I want to show people that Jesus is Savior. Jesus’ love towards me gives me the desire to tell others about Jesus. Maybe here on earth I will suffer for my faith in Jesus. Paul and the other apostles experienced a lot for the sake of the gospel. But I am sure that this present suffering is nothing compared to the glory that I will see when I am with Jesus in heaven. He promised me that I will be with Him forever in heaven and I want others to be with Jesus too.
  When I sin and God convicts me, I want to repent quickly and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Jesus, help me to sincerely grieve over my sin and fully submit to You. Thank you for Your grace and salvation.
