Summary: |-
  Some of the Jews wanted to kill Jesus. The Feast of Tabernacles was being held in Jerusalem (see Lev. 23:33-44, esp. verses 39-44, Num. 29:12-40, Deut. 16:13-17). Jesus’ brothers didn’t believe in Him and wanted Him to go to the celebration and publicly show that He was great. But Jesus decided to secretly go to the celebration. People had different opinions about Jesus. He taught openly in the temple. People were amazed at His teaching. Jesus said that His teaching was from God. The leaders were not happy that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, but Jesus said “ Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.” (v. 24) Verses 30-31 say, “Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 31 And many of the people believed in Him, and said, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?”
  “On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” (Jn 7:37-39) See also Is. 55:1 and Rev. 21:6, 22:17. People again wanted to arrest Jesus, but no one could lay a hand on Him because His time to die on the cross had not come yet. People knew that the Messiah should come from Bethlehem, but they didn’t know that Jesus was born there.

Application: |
  I believe that Jesus is the Messiah. He is the Savior who forgives my sin and gives me the Holy Spirit. I believe that Jesus has authority and I believe His Word, the Bible.
  People had different opinions about Jesus. Some people believed in Him and others wanted to kill Him. Do I believe in Him? Maybe some people are angry with me because of my faith in Jesus. __Jesus, help me to not be afraid of their opinions but to find my strength in You to love them and to boldly live for You.__
  Do I thirst? Just as water is needed for physical life, so Jesus is needed for spiritual life. I believe that I can come to Jesus and He will give me His Holy Spirit. His Holy Spirit changes me and will be in me forever, like a spring or fountain.
  Jesus offers salvation to all and wants all people to come to Him, the Messiah and Savior. His Holy Spirit is within me and I also want to invite people to come to Jesus for life.
  Rev. 22:17 “ And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.”
