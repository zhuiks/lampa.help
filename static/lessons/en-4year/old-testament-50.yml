Summary: |+
  When Jonathan saw David’s boldness, he gave him his armour as a gift and made a covenant of friendship with him. Saul kept David with him to serve him. People sang a song about how David was a great warrior and Saul was jealous of David (18:7). Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear. He made David a commander in the army and God was with David and helped him. Then Saul told David that he could marry his daughter if he killed 100 Philistines. He thought that the Philistines would kill David in battle, but David did what Saul wanted and became his son-in-law. Saul feared David because God was with him (18:12).
  Saul wanted to kill David, but Jonathan convinced his father not to do it. Later, Saul wanted to kill David again and was watching his house, but David’s wife helped him to run away (Ps. 59). David went to Samuel. When Saul wanted to take David away, all the people that he sent to get him began prophesying (speaking God’s word) because the Holy Spirit came upon them (19:23).
  David went to Jonathan and asked why Saul wanted to kill him. Jonathan had a plan to find out and later told David. Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and he knew that his father wanted to kill David. He was sad and told David that he should leave Saul. Jonathan and David promises to always be friends and to care for one another’s children (20:42).
  Ch. 21-22: David ran to Nob, where there was a priest. He asked for the bread that usually only the priests are allowed to eat. David lied and said that he was doing the king’s business. The priest gave him the bread and Goliath’s sword which was there. One of Saul’s servants, Doeg saw everything.
  David ran away further to the king of Gath (a pagan king). He regarded David as an enemy. Then David pretended to be crazy in order to run away from him (see Ps.34, 56). David left and lived far away from Saul (Ps. 63). His family and others gathered to him. Doeg told Saul that the priest helped David and so Saul killed the priest and his relatives (Ps. 52). One of them escaped to David and David promised to protect him.

  *Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not. You may want to read some of the psalms that could be from this period of David’s life.

Application: |
  God is faithful to me. He is my help and defence. Jesus is the most faithful friend. He showed His love when He died on the cross for my sins. He forgives my sin and gives me a new relationship with God. Through faith in Jesus, I can belong to God’s eternal family.
  When God is most important to us and to our friendships (as in the example of Jonathan and David’s friendship), we can be a good support to one another. Jesus shows me how to love and support others.
  Even when people don’t treat me well (as David experienced), I can know that God is with me and that He fulfills His good plan for my life. David was wrong when he answered the priest deceitfully. The priest suffered because of David’s lie. God, help me to trust You and to always answer honestly
  Jealous and envy (as we saw in Saul) destroys friendship and brings pain to all those around. __Jesus, forgive me when I envy. Give me a pure heart and a right attitude. Help me to trust You because You are the most faithful friend.__
