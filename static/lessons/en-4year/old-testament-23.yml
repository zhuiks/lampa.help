Book: 'Exodus: The Redemption of the Nation.'
Scripture: Exodus 11-12
Truth: Jesus frees us
Verse: Eph. 1:7 “In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins,
  according to the riches of His grace”
Summary: |-
  Before the 10th plague, the people were told to cover their doorways and windows with the blood of a lamb, so that God would not kill the firstborn in that house. During the night, God led His people out of slavery and saved them from the power of Pharaoh.

  see also Heb. 11:27-28 “By faith he left Egypt behind, not being afraid of the king’s anger, for Moses persevered as one who sees Him who is invisible. 28 By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites.”
Character:
- God is powerful
- He is Saviour
- God fulfills His promises
- God gives freedom
- Jesus is our perfect sacrifice for sin
- Jesus is our Passover Lamb
- God warns that He will punish disobedience
- Jesus’ blood saves from the wrath of God
Application: |
  The people of Israel were safe from God’s plague when they were in the house covered with the blood of the lamb. I am safe from God’s wrath when I believe that Jesus died for me and that His blood paid for my sin. The passover lamb was perfect. Jesus also is perfect. He never sinned. That’s why He could die for our sins.
  God brought the people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt and into freedom. God brings me out of  slavery to sin and into a life of freedom through faith in Jesus. God helped the people of Israel and He helps me. Sin makes me a slave and Jesus is the only help for me and all people in the world. __Jesus, You are my passover lamb. You died to take away my sin. Please forgive my sin. Thank you that I can know you and belong to God. Help me to tell others about salvation in You.__
