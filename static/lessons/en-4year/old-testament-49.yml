Summary: |+
  God told Samuel to anoint one of Jesse’s sons in Bethlehem as king over Israel. Jesse had 8 sons. Samuel thought that the oldest one would be king because of his appearance. But God said, “Do not look at his appearance or his stature, because I have rejected him. Man does not see what the Lord sees, for man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart” (16:7). Finally, they called David, the youngest son who was taking care of the sheep and God told Samuel to anoint him as king. The Holy Spirit filled David from that day forward (16:13).
  Later, during a time of war with the Philistines, Jesse sent David to bring cheese and bread to his brothers who were serving in the army with Saul. However, no one was fighting because they were afraid of the Philistines’ warrior, Goliath. He wanted to fight with one Israelite to decide the war. Goliath said rude things about God. David heard him, trusted God and decided to fight with him. Saul found out and wanted to give him armour, but it was too big for David. David chose 5 stones from the river and told Goliath, “You come against me with a dagger, spear, and sword, but I come against you in the name of Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel’s armies—you have defied Him…Today, I’ll strike you down… 47 and this whole assembly will know that it is not by sword or by spear that the Lord saves, for the battle is the Lord’s. He will hand you over to us” (17:45-47). God gave David and Israel victory over the Philistines.

Application: |
  God knows my thoughts and feelings. It’s important to God that I would have a heart that trusts Him. The priority is not how I look or what people think about me. __Jesus, please help me not to judge people by their outward appearance. Help me to trust you with all of my heart.__
  David knew that God is great and could give victory over the Goliath. He didn’t trust his own strength but trusted God. I also can trust God. When there are big problems and evil people, I can ask God for help. He gives me strength to stand against evil. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit, who helps me to love God, trust Him, live God’s way and share with people about Jesus.  __Jesus, give me a heart that trusts You and is ready to do what you ask me to do. Thank You that You give me strength by Your Holy Spirit to do what you show me to do. __
