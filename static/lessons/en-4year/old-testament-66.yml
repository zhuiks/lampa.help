Application: |
  These chapters contain lots of advice about how to live. Without Jesus’ righteousness and His Holy Spirit, I can’t live rightly. Without Jesus, I will be like the fool. __Thank you Jesus that You are alive and that you always are with me. You teach me and show me how to act wisely. Help me  to remember that the fear of the Lord (respect, reverence and love for God) is the beginning of wisdom. Jesus, teach me to love and follow you.__
