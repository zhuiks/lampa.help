Summary: |
  Ch. 23: David sought God’s will and saved the city of Keilah. Then, Saul found out that David was there and the people of the city were ready to betray him to Saul. Saul wanted to kill David. Jonathan came to David to strengthen him in trusting God. David was in the wilderness and Saul almost caught him on a mountain.
  Ch. 24: David was in a cave and Saul came in to sit there. David could have killed Saul, but he didn’t want to. Instead, he cut off a corner of his clothing and afterwards showed Saul to prove that he didn’t want to kill him.
  Ch. 25: Samuel died. David asked for food from Nabal, but Nabal answered him rudely and refused. David was angry and ready to kill Nabal, but Abigail, Nabal’s wife, acted wisely and asked David not to avenge himself. Later, Nabal died and Abigail became David’s wife.
  Ch. 26: People in the city of Ziph told Saul where he could find David (Ps. 54). He again sought to kill him. During the night, David went to Saul’s camp and could have killed him, but didn’t he want to. He took Saul’s spear and a jar from near his head. Then he stood far away and yelled to Abner (Saul’s army commander), that he should do a better job of protecting the king. Saul blessed David.
  Ch. 27: David was afraid of Saul and decided to live in the land of the enemy. He lived there for over a year. He raided surrounding cities of the enemy but the king of the land where he lived thought that David was loyal to him and not to Israel.

Application: |
  David trusted God and feared Him. He didn’t want to kill Saul, because he trusted God’s plan. Even though God had told David long before that he would be Israel’s king, David didn’t want to become king through murdering Saul. David trusted God for His timing to fulfill His plan. I can trust God that He will fulfill His plans in His time for my life. Even though Saul acted like David’s enemy, David continued to respect Saul. Maybe there are people in my life who treat me like an enemy, but God wants me to love them. He gives me strength and wisdom to love them.
  God sent Abigail to David when he started to avenge himself. God gave her wise words and David was thankful that he didn’t sin. Sometimes, God sends people to me to warn me. Am I ready to listen to their advice that helps me to trust God and not make a mistake? Am I ready to share advice from the Bible with people when God, by the Holy Spirit shows me that I should say something? Jesus, I want to trust You. Thank you, that you guide my life and help me to love my enemies.
