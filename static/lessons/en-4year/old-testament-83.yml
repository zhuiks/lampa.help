Summary: |+
  Ch. 21: Manasseh reigned in Jerusalem (in the southern kingdom) and did evil in the sight of God. He worshiped idols and led the people into idol worship. God sent his prophets to say that He would punish them for their disobedience. 2 Chron 33:10-13 records that God led Manasseh away to Assyria. There he repented and God returned him to Jerusalem. Then he knew that the Lord is God. Manasseh died and his son, Amon, became king. He abandoned the Lord and people killed him. Then his son Josiah became king when he was only 8 years old.
  Ch. 22: Josiah wanted to fix the temple. The high priest, Hilkiah helped him. They found the book of the Law (Scripture) in the temple and read it to the king. The king tore his clothing when he realized that his people had been disobedient to God’s Word and that they deserved punishment. He wanted to know what God thought about it all and asked a prophet to find out God’s will. The prophetess Huldah said that God would punish them after Josiah’s reign because he humbled himself before God. (also recorded in 2 Chron 34)
  Ch. 23: Josiah gathered people to Jerusalem and taught them God’s Word. He and the people promised to follow God. Hilkiah the priest cleansed the temple and destroyed all the idols. The king commanded that the whole land be cleansed of idols, places of idol worship and of idolatrous priests. Josiah turned to God with his whole heart. The people celebrated Passover. They hadn’t celebrated since the time when Samuel was alive (2 Chron. 35:1-19). Later, the king died in war against the king of Egypt (see 2 Chron 35:21 where he was warned).

  Zephaniah: Zephaniah spoke God’s Word during the days of king Josiah. God said that He would punish Jerusalem because people weren’t seeking Him and were walking away from Him (1:6). God calls people to seek Him, to humble themselves before Him and to do righteousness in order to find God’s mercy (2:3). God also punishes Assyria for their evil.
  The people didn’t listen to God (3:2) but God is righteous (3:5). God promises a glorious future where God Himself will reign as King among them (3:15-17).

  Jeremiah: God spoke His Word through Jeremiah, who was a priest during the time of Josiah, king of Judah. God told Jeremiah, “I chose you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born. I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”  Jeremiah wrote, “Then the Lord reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and told me: I have now filled your mouth with My words. 10 See, I have appointed you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and demolish, to build and plant” (1:9-10). God promised to help Jeremiah when people would be against him. “They will fight against you but never prevail over you, since I am with you to rescue you.” (1:19).

Application: |
  The Bible reveals God’s heart to me. In it, I can see what is pleasing to God and what is not. The people in Judah lost God’s Word and stopped loving God. They stopped listening to the warnings of His prophets (who shared God’s Word with them). But with Jesus’ help, I can read the Bible and listen to God! When I read it every day and seek God, He can teach me and change me.
  The people in Judah couldn’t follow God themselves and keep His law. They needed help from God. I also can’t live right in my own strength. Jesus helps me and gives me the Holy Spirit who lives in me and gives me strength and the desire to love God and others. The people celebrated Passover. I know that Passover speaks of Jesus. They remembered the time when God brought them out of slavery in Egypt and the blood of the lamb covered their homes. I know that the blood of Jesus paid for my sin and when i trust Jesus, He frees me from slavery to sin.
  Zephaniah said that God will punish non-believers. But He also promises that there will be a time when Israel will a blessed land for everyone and Jesus will reign there in Israel. I know that it’s important to tell people about the salvation that Jesus gives so that God’s wrath wouldn’t be upon them. I know that Jesus will return and I want to trust Him every day and tell people about Him while I wait for Him. He is King of kings and Lord of lords.
  God called Jeremiah to be His prophet and tell people His Words. Jesus calls me to be God’s child and share the good news of salvation with people. Jeremiah was young, but God promised to be with him and to help him. Jesus also calls the young, the old and everyone to follow Him. He promises to help us and even to give us the Holy Spirit who helps us every minute to love God and others. God showed Jeremiah that He has all authority and can do what He wants, just as the potter can with his clay. And so my life also belongs to Jesus and I can trust Him in all that He wants to do with my life. I can rejoice in God’s word in my life, knowing that He is wise, kind and loving. The people in Jeremiah’s time didn’t want to listen to God’s Word and made fun of Jeremiah. I don’t want to be like those who didn’t listen to God’s Word. Also, I should remember that sometimes people don’t receive God’s Word. Maybe they will even make fun of me. But God is with me and He is my help and defence. God punishes those that don’t believe in Jesus. That’s why I want to tell people that Jesus wants to forgive their sin. __Jesus, help me to share lovingly with people about salvation in You. Please save people, so that they won’t perish.__
