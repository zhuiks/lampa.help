Summary: |
  Samuel was old and his sons didn’t judge the people rightly, but took bribes. The Israelites asked Samuel to set a king over them, saying ”then we’ll be like all the other nations: our king will judge us, go out before us, and fight our battles” (8:20). Samuel didn’t want to, but God said, “they have not rejected you; they have rejected Me as their king” (8:7). Samuel met Saul when he was looking for his lost donkeys. God told Samuel that Saul would be Israel’s king. He anointed Saul as a sign that he was chosen by God. On the way home, the Holy Spirit came upon Saul and he started to prophesy (10:10). Later, Samuel gathered the people to officially present the new king. When Saul was called, they couldn’t find him because he hid himself. Saul was tall and handsome and when people saw him they shouted, “Long live the king!” (10:24).
  After some time, the Ammonites threatened an Israelite city and the people there asked for help and protection. When Saul heard about it, the Holy Spirit came upon him (11:6) and he called Israel to fight. God gave them victory and saved them from their enemies. Later, Samuel talked with the people and warned them saying “…don’t turn away from following the Lord. Instead, worship the Lord with all your heart. 21 Don’t turn away to follow worthless things that can’t profit or deliver you; they are worthless” (12:20-21) and “Above all, fear the Lord and worship Him faithfully with all your heart; consider the great things He has done for you. 25 However, if you continue to do what is evil, both you and your king will be swept away” (12:24-25).

Application: |
  Samuel warned the people to not stop loving God with their whole hearts. __Jesus, help me by Your Holy Spirit to love You more and more with my whole heart. I myself can’t love you and be obedient to you without your help. I depend upon You. Lead me and my life. Be the king of my heart. Remind me of all  your great deeds (salvation, victory on the cross, healing, miracles etc.).__
  What does a king do? Do people listen to him? Why? How does the example of an earthly king help me to understand my relationship to Jesus? Jesus is the righteous, eternal, wise and loving King. He is worthy of honor and praise. I can trust God because He is a righteous King who controls everything. I know that God and His plans (and not mine) are the most important. He has a right to lead my life in the way that He wants and I can be happy to walk with Him. I know that God’s leading is for my good.
