Verse: Rom 12:1-2 “ I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that
  you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your
  reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed
  by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable
  and perfect will of God.” or Rom. 12:21 “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome
  evil with good”
Summary: |
  Believers live in submission to God, as “a living sacrifice”, as they worship God. They love people and use the gifts of the Holy Spirit. God wants us to love even our enemies. “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” (12:21)
  Believers respect the government. “Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law” (13:8) Believers live pleasing to God. they don’t live according to the desires of the flesh. “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.” (13:14)
  We don’t judge one another when there are different opinions about what is alright to eat or which day of the week is more important. We should love one another. “for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 For he who serves Christ in these things  is acceptable to God and approved by men. 19 Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another. ” (14:17-19)
  In church, there are different people with different traditions but we are all one in Christ. “Now may the God of patience and comfort grant you to be like-minded toward one another, according to Christ Jesus, 6 that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.” (15:5-7) God sent Jesus to the Jews according to His promise and Scripture says a lot about God’s plan to save the Gentiles. Paul wanted to preach about Jesus in places where people hadn’t heard about Him yet. He quoted the prophet Isaiah, “To whom He was not announced, they shall see; And those who have not heard shall understand” (15:21) Paul wanted to go to Rome.
  Paul sent a greeting to believers that he knew in Rome. He warned them not to listen to people who wanted to divide them and teach what was wrong. He wanted them to be wise in what is good and innocent about what is evil. (16:19)

Application: |
  I belong to Jesus. My life and all that I do and desire and strive for is submitted to Jesus. I am, “a living sacrifice” and worship Him with my life. How can I live for Jesus? In chapter 12 there are a lot of practical examples and advice. I want to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit to love believers. It is written that I should love my enemies.__ Jesus, help me to love my enemies. You overcame evil with good when You died on the cross. You died for me when I was still a sinner. Thank You for Your love. Help me to love my enemies with the same love.__
  There are many different kinds of people and people groups (nationalities) in church. Thank you, Jesus that you saved us all! Help us to love one another and not quarrel about things that aren’t important (about food and people’s traditions). __Jesus, help me to love my brothers and sisters and live in unity with them.__
   I learned earlier that Jesus’ righteousness saves me and that I am not under the Law but under grace. Jesus changes me and gives me love from the Holy Spirit. It’s written, “loving another is the fulfillment of the Law.” Jesus Himself gives me love for God and other people. __Jesus, fill me with Your Love and show me how to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit for edifying believers, how to love my enemies, how to live in unity with believers and how to share the gospel with people who don’t know You. Strengthen my faith in Jesus.__
