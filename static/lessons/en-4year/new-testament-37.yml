If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? 13 And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish”

Application: |
  Jesus said that I have an angel who always sees God’s face (v. 10). Jesus guards me. Jesus came to earth to save me and all people. Without Jesus, I am like a lost sheep, who got lost in the mountains. Without Jesus’ help, I will perish. But He seeks me and wants me to be a part of his flock so that He can take care of me forever. How does He seek me? When I hear stories about Jesus, when I hear songs about Jesus, when people talk about Jesus, that is when He is calling me to Himself. Through all those things, He reveals Himself to me, so that I would come to Him. When I believe in Jesus, then He received me into His Kingdom, where there is joy, peace and love. I can tell others about Jesus so that they would come to Him and know that Jesus is Savior. Maybe they don’t know that life without Jesus is very dangerous. I can tell them that Jesus wants to care for them, forgive their sin and receive them into His Heavenly Kingdom. Jesus, help me to tell my friends, relatives and neighbors that You want to and are able to save them. This is Your will, that people would not perish (see John 3:16).
  In verses 21-35, Jesus taught that if I don’t forgive another person’s sin, that means that I don’t understand His forgiveness towards me. __Jesus, help me to forgive those who sin against me because You have forgiven me! Give me strength to forgive. Give me a humble heart that understands Your Great Love. You laid down your life for me, Jesus, even though I deserve punishment. Thank you for Your forgiveness. I want Your forgiveness of my sin to change my life.__
