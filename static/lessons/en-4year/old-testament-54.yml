  King David helped to set up and organize how God was worshipped musically. He used to play on his harp when he was a shepherd (1 Sam.16:19-23) and here he encouraged many others to praise God in song.  In the psalms, I see that creation and all people praise God. I can sing songs to God or play on an instrument or simply say that I love God. I can draw Him a picture or write a list of all the reason that I love Him. I can remember His great deeds, that He did during the Bible times and that He now does in my life and the lives of others. I praise God that He saved me. He is great and worthy of praise. When I’m sad or disappointed, I can remember who God is and praise Him for all that He has done, is doing and will do. Praise Jesus!!!

  *Korah’s rebellion is detailed in Num. 16, when this Levite didn’t want to submit to God’s instructions on which of the Levites would serve the Lord in specific ways. All those who rebelled were punished by the Lord, but it’s wonderful to see that many generations later, the sons of Korah were joyfully praising the Lord in song and leading others in worship.
