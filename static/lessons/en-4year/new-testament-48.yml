Summary: |+
  At night, Jesus and His disciples prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. But the disciples fell asleep. Jesus prayed to the Father and said  “…Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done “ (Matt. 26:39). Then Judas Iscariot came with soldiers and betrayed Jesus with a kiss. Peter wanted to fight, but Jesus forbid him and even healed the person that Peter hurt. Jesus went with them.

Application: |
  Jesus knew that He would die on the cross. That’s why He prayed to God the Father. He asked His friends to pray with Him. He gave us an example. When things are hard for me or I’m scared, I can pray to the Heavenly Father just like Jesus. I also can ask my friends to pray for me and with me. Maybe my friends can’t understand me or support me in the way that I need (Jesus’ friends fell asleep!), but Jesus hears my prayers and He is with me. He is my help. He understands me because He also experienced hard times.
  Jesus chose to fulfill the will of God the Father and fulfill Scripture by dying for my sins. He didn’t hide in the garden; He didn’t run from the soldiers. Even though He could have called angels to fight for Him (Matt. 26:53), He bravely went with the soldiers because He knew that it was God’s plan from eternity to die for our sins. I don’t doubt that Jesus is the Son of God and that He loves me. I am very thankful to Jesus for His Great Love. Jesus fulfilled the will of the Father and not His own. Jesus and the Father’s will were the same. Jesus helps me to fulfill His will and not my own. He helps me so that what I want is the same as what God wants. Often, my will is selfish (something that makes only me glad), but God’s will is what makes Jesus glad.__ Jesus, help me to fulfill Your will and serve and love as You do.__
