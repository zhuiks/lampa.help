Summary: |
  Samuel lived at the tabernacle, the place of worship and served God with Eli the priest (someone who helps people to worship God). The sons of Eli served at the tabernacle but they didn’t love God and they did bad things. God sent a person to tell Eli that God didn’t like what they were doing and He would punish them (1 Sam. 2:27-36). One night, Samuel heard God’s voice calling him. He didn’t understand and thought Eli was calling him. Eli didn’t understand right away that God was calling Samuel. When Samuel heard God’s words to him, he shared them with Eli. God told Samuel what the first person said: that God would judge Eli’s family and their sin against Him. Samuel served God and did what was pleasing to God. He was a prophet (a person who receives God’s Word and shares it with people).
Character:
- God is sovereign (God controls everything)

- God punishes sin.God is holy
- He is worthy to receive sincere worship
- God speaks to us
Application: |
  Samuel was a young boy, but God spoke to Him. God also speaks to me through His Word, the Bible. I can know what is pleasing to God through His Word. God had a plan for Samuel’s life and God has a plan my life. God saw the sin of Eli’s sons and punished them. God knows everything that I do, think and say. Am I pleasing God in the way that I live? He doesn’t want me to act like I’m worshiping Him when my heart is not really loving Him. Jesus helps me to live God’s way. His Holy Spirit gives me love for God and others (Rom 5:5). Samuel shared God’s words and  God wants me to share His Word with other people. Jesus, speak to me, I am listening to your Word.
  1 Sam. 3:7 says, “Now Samuel had not yet experienced the Lord, because the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.” He was in the place of worship, but he himself did not yet know God. I can go to church, where people worship God but may not know Jesus. Samuel heard God’s Word and believed it. He then began to personally fellowship with God. I also want to know God’s Word (the Bible) and believe what I read. I want to personally seek Jesus and follow Him. Have I asked Jesus to forgive my sin? Do I believe that Jesus is God, that he died for my sins, rose again and wants to give me forgiveness and a new heart that loves God and others? Do I want to tell people about Jesus, the Savior and warn them that God will punish those that don’t receive the gift of salvation? Jesus is calling me every day to follow Him. In Jesus is life, hope, joy, peace and love.
