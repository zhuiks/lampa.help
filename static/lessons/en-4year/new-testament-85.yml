Title: The Spiritual Blessings in Christ
Book: 'Ephesians: Unification in Christ. (1:3)'
Scripture: Eph. 1-3
Truth: Jesus saves by grace
Verse: Eph 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of
  yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.”
Summary: |
  After Paul and a group of believers were in Philippi, they traveled to many cities and shared about Jesus. They were in Ephesus. The first time Paul was there for a short time but other believers stayed there (Acts 18:18-21). Then he went back and was with the believers there for 3 years (Acts 20:31).
  Spiritual Blessings: In Jesus Christ, believers have every spiritual blessing in the heavens. In Jesus, God gives believers holiness, makes them His children, gives them forgiveness, gives them an inheritance in heaven and the Holy Spirit (1:1-14).
  Saved by Grace: “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast” (Eph 2:8-9). Earlier, we were all under the influence of sin and were God’s enemies. But now, in Jesus each believer is a new creation of God that fulfills the plans that God has for them. (2:10).
  Unity in Christ: Jesus makes Jewish and Gentile believers one in Himself. They aren’t divided anymore. (2:14-16) The Church (Jews and Gentiles together) show God’s wisdom to the spiritual world (3:10).

- Jesus saves by grace
- Jesus makes all believers one
- Jesus is the head of the Church
- Jesus is our Protection

Application: |
  Jesus saved me and changes my life. I used to be far from God and was His enemy. Believers in Jesus believe: that He is God, that He never sinned, that He fulfilled God’s law, that He took my punishment in my place for my disobedience, that He died and rose again, that He forgave my sin and gave me the Holy Spirit and that He loves me. Do I believe in Jesus? When I believe in Him, I love Him. When I love Him, I love other people, especially believers. When I believe in Him, I ask Him and He gives me strength to love Him and others and to resist evil. He helps me.
  Jesus saved me and others by grace alone. Grace is when God gives me His undeserved kindness, mercy and love. No one deserves anything good from God, but Jesus offers me and all people His grace. I never can do enough good in order to be accepted by God. Only Jesus could fulfill the whole Law, die for the sin of the world and rise again. Now through Jesus and only through Jesus all the spiritual riches belong to me in Christ Jesus! I want to share this good news with other people. I don’t want them to be children of wrath who aren’t friends with God. I want them to become children of God through faith in Jesus and the knowledge of His love and grace. Who can I tell about Jesus’ grace? __Jesus, help me to understand for myself and to share with others about your grace.__
