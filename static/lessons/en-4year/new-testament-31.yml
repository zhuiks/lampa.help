Summary: |
  Verses 1-21: Jesus is the  Messiah who fulfills prophecy. (Isaiah 42:1-5, Matt. 12:15-21)
  Verses 22-37: Jesus healed a demon-possessed man. People thoughе, шsn’t this the Christ (Messiah)? But the Pharisees said that Jesus drove demons out with the power of demons. Jesus explained that this cannot be and taught that a person’s words come from out of their heart. Their words show what is in their hearts.

Application: |
  What do I believe about Jesus? What I believe about Him determines my relationship before God: how I live, what is in my heart, where I will be in eternity. What I believe about Jesus determines whose control I am under (demons, the world, Jesus). It determines what kingdom I’m in now (the heavenly one (Col. 1:13) or the earthly one (Eph. 2:2) and to what family I belong (the family of God, see Matt. 12:50 or not the family of God, see Eph 2:4). What I believe about Jesus makes me either a good or bad tree. What I believe in my heart about Jesus will be visible through my words. When I believe in Jesus can I say bad things about another person? Can I tell a lie? Can I answer people rudely or impatiently? When I believe in Jesus I am like the good tree that brings good fruit. I remember the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 2:22-23).
  When I trust Jesus, I don’t want to say something bad because Jesus’ love is in my heart. I love God and others and I can express this love in words sometimes. In the passage, people rudely accused Jesus saying that He drove out demons with demonic power. They were showing with their words that they didn’t trust Jesus. I can tell people what I believe about Jesus. I can tell them that He is great and greater than all. I can tell them about Jesus’ love and also show them the love of Jesus with my actions. Just as a tree brings forth fruit, so my life can bring God’s love to people. Jesus, help me to trust You and show people that You are greater than all.
  Jesus came to the Jews but many of them didn’t receive Him even though He was their long-awaited Savior of whom the Law and Prophets spoke. Jesus is the Saviour of All who trust in Him. This is why Jesus gave the example of Gentiles who repented and sought God. The Ninevites at the time of Jonah responded to the call to repentance and humbled themselves before God. Jesus called the Jews to repentance but some of them didn’t want to repent. During Solomon’s time, the Queen of Sheba came from afar to see the king’s glory and seek his wisdom. People stood before Jesus and didn’t want to repent of their sins and didn’t want to hear the wisdom of Jesus, the King of the Universe. Today also, Jesus is greater than the prophet Jonah. He calls me and others to repentance. Do I want to come to Jesus to be justified, forgiven and sanctified? Today, Jesus is greater than Solomon. Jesus is a Glorious King who has all wisdom. Do I want to come to Jesus and become a part of His kingdom and receive wisdom from Him?
  (to better understand Matt. 12:32, see John 15:26, 16:8-15 and Acts 1:8. The Holy Spirit testified of Jesus and helps believers to witness of Him. In life, each of us has an opportunities to trust Jesus as Lord and Savior. Maybe someone spoke bad things about Jesus earlier. He forgives them when they trust in Him. After death a person who has rejected the conviction of the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.)
