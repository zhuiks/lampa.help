Summary: |-
  Paul, Silas, Timothy and others were in Thessalonica. There, Paul preached about Jesus in the synagogue for 3 weeks. Some believed in Jesus while others were jealous that the Gentiles started to believe. The non-believers stirred up problems and as a result, the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea where people studied the scriptures carefully. (17:10-11) They received the truth. Later, wicked people from Thessalonica came and so Paul traveled on further to Athens and waited for his friends. He was sad to see the city full of idols. He spoke with people about Jesus and they invited him to share in the Areopagus (a place in the city where they discussed different teachings and philosophies). Some people laughed and others believed when he spoke about the resurrection of Jesus.
   Later, Paul went to Corinth. He met and worked with Aquila and Priscilla. He preached about Jesus when his friends came from Macedonia, “And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized. 9 Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent; 10 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.” 11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.” (18:8-11) The unbelieving Jews wanted to accuse Paul in court but they were unsuccessful.

Application: |
  I see that according to Scripture, the Good News about Jesus is for all people, in any place, in any culture, in any time. He is the only Savior, independent of what people believed before or knew about God. Some people believed when Paul and his friends told about Jesus. Some people were really against them and started big problems in the city. But their reaction didn’t change the truth that Jesus is the Only Savior. When I share with people about Jesus, I can expect that some will believe in Jesus and some will not. I should remember that Jesus is with me and that He gives me His Holy Spirit in order to know what to say and how to act and how to love people. In Athens, there were many idols and people loved to discuss different ideas, religions and philosophy. This happens today as well. People are searching for the truth or just love to be distracted by different ideas. __Jesus, help me to share with people so that they would know that You are the only Savior. Give me boldness to love them and wisdom to know what to say that they would turn to You.__
