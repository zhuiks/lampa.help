Application: |
  The people continued to rebuild the walls even though the enemy threatened them and said bad things about them. But Nehemiah and the people of Jerusalem decided to listen to God’s voice and not the voice of the enemy. I can choose to listen to God’s voice and live according to the Word and not listen to the voice of those who do not love God. Sometimes even friends distract me from God and say that I’m silly (foolish) when I don’t do what they want. But I know that the opinion of God is more important. I know that He gives me strength to continue to follow Jesus. He is my help and defence. God, help me to fulfill Your plan. Nehemiah led the people in rebuilding the walls. __Jesus, show me, what I can “build” in Your kingdom. Help me to begin,  continue and finish Your work that You have for me. Help me to trust You when people want to scare me or distract me. Jesus, You are my help. May everyone see that what You do through my life is truly God’s work and not man’s.__
