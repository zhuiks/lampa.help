Application: |
  I am amazed that God had a plan to send Jesus to us from a long time ago (even from eternity!). God in the Bible talks specifically about Jesus: where He would be born, what He would do and why. I can trust the Bible and know that all that is written in it is true. I am thankful to Jesus that He came to save me. Only Jesus could fulfill all of these prophesies. I am confident that the Bible is the truth and that Jesus is the Only Savior. I want to tell others about Jesus so that they also would know that He is Savior.
