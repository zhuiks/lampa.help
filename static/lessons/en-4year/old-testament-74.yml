Summary: |+
  Ch. 5:Naaman was a famous successful soldier in the land of Israel’s enemies but he had a terrible skin disease. Once, he took captive a girl from Israel and she served  his wife. The girl shared about a prophet in Israel who could help Naaman. The king of Syria wrote a letter to the king of Israel about Naaman but the king of Israel didn’t know how to help him and was upset. The prophet Elisha heard about it and said that Naaman could come to him. Naaman came to Elisha on his chariot with lots of people and expensive gifts but the prophet didn’t even come out of his house to meet him and told him to wash 7 times in the Jordan river.
  Naaman was upset and had expected different help. He didn’t want to do what Elisha said but his servant said, that really what the prophet told him to do wasn’t hard. The prophet told him to wash and that then he would be clean and healthy. Naaman washed 7 times and on the 7th time, according to the Word of God, he became clean! He wanted to give Elisha a lot of presents but Elisha wouldn’t take anything from him. Naaman said that now he would only worship God. After this he started on his way home but Elisha’s servant Gehazi caught up to Naaman and lied to him so that he could get some presents from him. He got the gifts and hid them but God showed Elisha what Gehazi had done and put on him the skin disease that had been on Naaman.
  Ch. 6: God made an axe head float, to help the man retrieve it from the river. God told Elisha the enemy’s position so as to warn the king of Israel. The enemy came to get Elisha and surrounded his city and his servant was afraid. “Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.” 17 Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, please open his eyes and let him see.” So the Lord opened the servant’s eyes. He looked and saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (17-18). God made the enemy blind and Elisha led them to Israel’s king. The king fed them and sent them away. Later, there was a famine in the land and the king was angry with God and wanted to kill Elisha.
  Ch. 7: God promised to help the people the next day but one man didn’t believe. Elisha said that this man wouldn’t take part in the blessing. God used 4 lepers to find the enemy’s camp, where God had already driven them away. The lepers told their city about the treasures and God blessed the city, but the man who didn’t believe was trampled by the crowd at the gate. As God said, he didn’t partake of the blessing.

Application: |
  God showed grace and mercy to Naaman. He freely healed him. Elisha didn’t take gifts from Naaman so that he would understand this about God. Jesus freely saves me by His grace. I can’t do anything to deserve or earn His kindness. I can follow Elisha’s example and help people without expecting anything in return. I can follow the little girl’s example and tell people about the greatness of my God. I can also follow Naaman’s example and come to God for healing from sickness and for cleansing from sin.  But I better not follow Gehazi’s example, being sneaky and greedy. This is sin. God sees everything and I can never trick Him. When I sin, I can ask forgiveness from Jesus and ask Him to help me to be honest, loving and giving.
