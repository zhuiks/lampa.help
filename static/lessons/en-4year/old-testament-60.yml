Summary: |
  *the events of 2 Sam. 21-24 took place earlier, but it’s not known exactly when during David’s reign
  Ch. 21: David asked God why there was a famine in the land. The previous king, Saul and his sons had killed Gibeonites, whom the Israelites had promised to protect. The Gibeonites asked for the death of those who had done that wrong (1-14). David and his army killed the enemy (15-22).
  Ch. 22: David sang a song to God.
  Ch. 23: Songs of praise (v. 1-7). David had many brave warriors who fought well.
  Ch. 24: David decided to count the people in his kingdom even though he wasn’t suppose to do that. He repented. The prophet Gad said that God gave David a choice between 3 consequences for his sin. David chose to fall into the hands of God, because He is merciful (v. 14). God killed many people in Israel. David saw an angel of the Lord and asked God for mercy. God told David through the prophet Gad to build an altar in a certain place. David bought the place, built an altar and offered sacrifices to the Lord. Then the Lord stopped striking the people.
  1 Kings 1: David was old and his son Adonijah made himself king. David’s army commander Joab supported him. But the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, spoke with David. David wanted Solomon to be king after him. They anointed Solomon and the whole city celebrated. Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, but Solomon said that if he would act rightly, he wouldn’t kill him.
  Ch. 2:1-12: David commanded Solomon to follow God and to punish his enemies.
  1 Chron 22, 28-29: David told Solomon to build the temple. He told the Israelites and Solomon to follow God. He gave Solomon plans and treasures for the temple. David prayed to God before the whole assembly of people.

Character:

- God is trustworthy
- Jesus is King from the line of David
- Jesus is God
Application: |
  David is an example of a person who followed God. He trusted God and loved HIm. There were moments in David’s life when he didn’t trust God and sinned. There were consequences for his sin and he repented before God. I want to follow Jesus. When I don’t love God and sin, I desire to turn to Jesus right away for forgiveness and help to do what is right. God showed David mercy and fulfilled His promises to him in that his son reigned after him and there was always someone from his house who could sit on the throne. I know that Jesus was born from the line of David and that God fulfilled His promise to David through Jesus.
  God said that David was a man after his own heart (Acts 13:22). I want to be a person after God’s own heart. __Jesus, help me to trust You in everything, today and till the end. Thank you, that You are faithful to help me, lead me and strengthen me. Fill my heart with thankfulness to You that You are My Faithful God and Savior.__
