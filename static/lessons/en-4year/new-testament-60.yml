Summary: |-
  Herod put Peter in prison and wanted to kill him. The church was praying for him. “And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands” (v.6 -7). The angel led Peter out of prison. Peter went to Mary’s house (the mother of John-Mark) where the believers were praying for him. At first, they didn’t believe that Peter came to them and then they were astonished. Then Peter went to a different place.
  Herod was prideful and died. Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch from Jerusalem and took John-Mark with them.

Application: |
  Peter boldly shared with people about Jesus. That is why Herod put him in prison and wanted to kill him. But God had a plan. He freed Peter miraculously because He had a special plan for Peter’s life. I can boldly share about Jesus as the Holy Spirit leads me. I know that Jesus is always with me. He can save me out of danger if that is His plan. Nothing and no one can get in the way of God’s plan. __Jesus, give me boldness to follow You. I know that You are the only Saviour. I want everyone to know that only you give forgiveness, love, and true life. Help me to love You and not be afraid of people and evil. You overcame the world, sin and evil. You are for me and I belong to you. As long as I live, You are with me and when I die, You will be with me and I will be with you forever. Thank you!__
  The church didn’t know what God’s plan was for Peter but they prayed for him. I don’t always know what God wants to do but I can pray for others. I can pray with believers. God hears my prayers and always answers. Sometimes God doesn’t answer the way that I expect but He answers. __Thank you, Lord, that you hear my prayers and that you fulfill Your plan.__
