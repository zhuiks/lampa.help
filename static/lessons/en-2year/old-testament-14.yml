Summary: |-
  Just as God said, there was a famine in the land. Joseph sold bread to everyone. Joseph’s brothers came to buy bread. He recognized them but they didn’t recognize him. He put them all in prison for 3 days and after that kept Simeon in prison and wanted them to bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to Egypt. Joseph put the money for the bread back in his brothers’ bags. When the brothers came again, they ate at Joseph’s house. He hid a cup in Benjamin’s bag and accused him of stealing it. The brothers wanted to help Benjamin. Then Joseph told them that he was their brother. They were afraid that he would punish them but Joseph forgave them. Later, all the brothers brought their father and they moved to Egypt, because there was bread there. Jacob spoke with Pharaoh. Jacob (Israel) blessed all 12 of his sons. When Jacob died, the brothers were afraid again, thinking that Joseph would punish them. But Joseph said that he trusts and respects God. He forgave his brothers.
Character:
- God is merciful
- Jesus forgives our sin
- He provides
- Jesus reconciles us with Himself and others
Application: |
  I can trust God that He will work everything out for the good. Jesus died to forgive me of my sins. When I trust in Him, He forgives me and with His help, I can forgive others. __God, please forgive me for…God, show me who I need to forgive and help me to forgive them right now.__
  Joseph tested his brother’s hearts when he put them in prison when he said that Benjamin stole the cup. Maybe he wanted to see if they would help their brother or leave him. How I act when things are hard shows God, me and others what is in my heart. __Jesus, please fill my heart with love and grace. When things are hard, help me to forgive, love and do the right thing.__
  Note: Depending upon your group, you may want to discuss the ways that Joseph reminds us of Jesus. For example: both were betrayed by their own, both were accused and punished although they were innocent, both forgave their enemies and helped them to live.
