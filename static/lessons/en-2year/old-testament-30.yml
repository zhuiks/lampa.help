Summary: |
  The Israelites asked Samuel to set a king over them. Although God said that they were rejecting Him, He set a king over them. Samuel met Saul when he was looking for his lost donkeys. God told Samuel to anoint Saul as a sign that he was chosen by God to be king. When Saul heard that enemies threatened an Israelite city, the Holy Spirit came upon him and he called all Israel to fight against the enemy. He led the people and God gave them victory and saved them from the enemy.
  Later,  Saul gathered the army to fight the Philistines, but the people were afraid and hid themselves. Saul did not wait for Samuel and decided to sacrifice an offering to God himself. Samuel told Saul that because of his disobedience, the kingdom would be given to another.
  1 Sam. 15: Samuel told Saul that God wanted to send him to fight against the Amalekites and get rid of everything and everyone. The Amalekites had been mean to Israel earlier when they were coming out of slavery from Egypt. Saul won the battle but let the Amalekite king and the best of his animals live. Later, Saul put up a memorial to himself. Samuel came and told Saul that he had been disobedient to God. Saul did not admit his guilt right away and tried to explain that what he did was fine. God through Samuel said that obeying God’s voice is more important that offering sacrifices. Samuel also said “you rejected God’s word and He has rejected you, so you won’t be king, but He will set up a new person over Israel.” (1 Sam.15:26) Saul was very upset and said that he had been afraid of the people and that was why he acted that way. When Samuel wanted to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his clothing and part of it tore off. He really wanted Samuel to go with him to worship God in front of the people. God was sad that Saul was a disobedient king. Samuel continued to pray for Saul.

Application: |
  The Israelites wanted a king to lead them. God gave them Saul. Leaders can be good but people will always fail.  Jesus is the best King. He is King of kings. I want Him to be the King of my heart. Saul was afraid of what people thought more than what God thought. When I trust Jesus, I don’t need to be afraid of what people think. I should wait to find out what God thinks about a situation and then act according to God’s will. I should listen to King Jesus. Jesus, help me to not fear people’s opinion but to follow and respect You. Show me in Your Word what is pleasing to You and help me to trust You and do it.
