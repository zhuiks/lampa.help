- He is Saviour

- Jesus is our perfect sacrifice for sin
- Jesus is our Passover Lamb
Application: |
  The people of Israel were safe from God’s plague when they were in the house covered with the blood of the lamb. I am safe from God’s wrath when I believe that Jesus died for me and that His blood paid for my sin. The passover lamb was perfect. Jesus also is perfect. He never sinned. That’s why He could die for our sins.
  God brought the people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt and into freedom. God brings me out of  slavery to sin and into a life of freedom through faith in Jesus. God helped the people of Israel and He helps me. Sin makes me a slave and Jesus is the only help for me and all people in the world. __Jesus, You are my passover lamb. You died to take away my sin. Please forgive my sin. Thank you that I can know you and belong to God. Help me to tell others about salvation in You.__
