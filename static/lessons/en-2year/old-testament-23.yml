Summary: |
  God’s people live and are led in a special way.
  Lev. 5, 11,19  God wanted His people to be holy, that is, separate and different. He gave them rules for bringing sacrifices to Him, for what they should eat and how to treat one another.
  God gave the priests (those who helped the people to worship God) a blessing to say to the people: Num. 6:24-26 ““The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.”’
  Starting from the time that the Israelites left Egypt, God led His people everyday. Ex.13:21-22 “And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people.” God’s pillar moved in order to lead them to the promised land. Sometimes the pillar was in one place for a short time and sometimes for a long time but when the pillar started to move, the people were suppose to gather their things and follow it. (Num. 9:15-23)

Application: |
  God gave His people special rules to live holy, separate, different and clean. They were suppose to be different from the other people around them. But these laws didn’t change the hearts of the people. Only Jesus can make me clean and holy. Only Jesus can help me to love God and to live pleasing to God. He gives me a new heart to love Him and His ways. He gives me His Holy Spirit so that I can live differently from the world (not selfish) and for God (that I would be like Jesus).
  God led the Israelites every day. He will show me where to go and what to do when I ask Him to lead me. God leads me day and night and will never leave me. Jesus is always with me and He leads my life. The Bible shows me God’s way. The Holy Spirit helps me  to follow Jesus.
  Extra explanation about the sacrifices: When the people of Israel sinned (didn’t love God) through their actions and words, God wanted them to bring different sacrifices to the tabernacle. When they did something their own way and not God’s way, they were suppose to bring a sacrifice because the blood covered their sin. Sin (when we don’t love God) leads to death. The blood of the animal sacrifice was in place of the blood of the person who sinned. When they saw the blood of the animal, the remembered that their sin led to death and that they need forgiveness for their sins from God. But the blood of animals can’t make a person’s heart clean. Only Jesus can. He shed His blood for my sin on the cross and now through faith in Him and His perfect sacrifice, He forgives my sins and gives me  a new heart!
