Summary: |
  On the third day when Jesus rose, two disciples were walking on the road to Emmaus. Jesus walked nearby with them but they didn’t recognize Him (Lk.24:16). Jesus heard their conversation about His resurrection, the empty grave, the angel’s words and what the women saw. He explained to them what is written about Him in Scripture. They came to Emmaus and invited Jesus to eat with them. They started to eat together and when Jesus took the bread to thank God, their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus! Then He disappeared! They decided to hurry back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples that they saw Jesus, even though it was already evening.
  They told the disciples in Jerusalem that they saw the Risen Lord Jesus and all of the sudden, He appeared in the room with them. At that time, Thomas wasn’t with them and he didn’t believe that the others saw Jesus. He wanted to see the wounds of Jesus himself and be sure that Jesus was alive. After eight days, Thomas was with the disciples and Jesus appeared again. “Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.”  And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (Jn. 20:27-29).

Application: |
  I believe that Jesus rose from the dead even though I don’t see Him like His disciples saw Him. Others saw Him and passed on to us the truth that Jesus is alive. Jesus explained that the whole Bible talks about Him (Jn 5:39-40). God said earlier in the Word that He would send a Saviour who would die for everyone’s sins and rise again on the third day. The words of Moses, the prophets and many psalms talk about Jesus. I see that Jesus fulfills these Word of prophecy. I can trust the Bible.
  Jesus gives those who believe in Him the Holy Spirit (John 20:22-23). I rely upon God’s power to follow after Jesus and to tell others about Him.  The disciples told others that Jesus is alive. I also can tell people, friends and relatives that Jesus is alive. I can tell them that He died for our sins and can forgive us because He paid for our sins (He took our punishment and paid with His blood). Jesus heard that Thomas wanted to touch His wounds. Jesus knows all my thoughts and hears all my words. He doesn’t want me to doubt Him but helps me to trust Him.
  Jesus promises to raise to life those who believe in Him. The Risen Lord Jesus ate and could appear in rooms that were locked. This was His glorified body. He promises to give each believer in Him a glorified body. That body will never get sick because then there will be no more sin. When we have our glorified body, we will live with Jesus. He already conquered sin but we are waiting for that day when Jesus will return again and take us to be with Him. He gives believers in Him salvation and new life now but we also are waiting for the day when He will save us from this fallen world and give us new life in His presence forever in heaven! While we wait, we can tell everyone that Jesus is alive, that He wants to forgive sins and that He is coming soon to save His own and to punish those who don’t believe in Him. see also 1 Cor. 15:54-57
