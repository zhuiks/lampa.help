Summary: |
  In Acts 3, Peter and John went to the temple to pray and saw a man who was crippled from birth and was begging for money near the gate. “Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” (Acts 3:6). They helped him to stand on his feet and he started to walk and praise God. Everyone saw that he, who couldn’t walk before, was healed. Peter preached to the people about Jesus and said that Jesus healed, that He died, rose again and forgives the sins of those who believe in Him (Acts 3:19).
  Acts  4: The priests and other leaders didn’t like it that they were talking about Jesus and the resurrection. They put them in prison. But many people heard about Jesus and around 5,000 people believed! In the morning, Peter and John answered that Jesus healed the person and that “… there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved”(Acts 4:12). The leaders forbid them to speak about Jesus, “But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” (Acts 4:19-20). The leaders let them go and the believers gathered to pray that God would continue to give them boldness “and when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:31)

Application: |
  On their way to prayer, Peter and John saw the man in need. They gave the man what they could: the good news about Jesus! Jesus can help people. When I see people’s needs, I can tell them that Jesus can help them. A crowd of people saw how the crippled man was healed. Peter and John didn’t want glory for themselves but told everyone that Jesus healed him. They told them about salvation in Jesus. 5,000 people believed because they shared the truth (Acts 4:4). I want to give the glory to Jesus when He does something good in my life and the lives of others. I want to tell the truth about Jesus so that people would believe in Him.
  Peter and John knew that the leaders of their city recently crucified Jesus. They put them in prison for their faith in Him. Maybe they thought that the leaders wanted to kill them just like they killed Jesus. But in the morning, when the leaders spoke with them they shared about Jesus with boldness. The leaders weren’t happy but didn’t kill them. Peter and John loved Jesus and wanted to tell the truth about Him. Maybe they were scared but Jesus with the Holy Spirit helped them. Jesus helps me too with His Holy Spirit. When I’m scared, I can ask for help from Jesus to tell the truth even when people won’t like it.
  Peter and John prayed to God for help to speak with boldness about Jesus. __Jesus, please help me to be bold and to speak the truth about You.__
