Summary: |
  Job loved God. He was a rich and successful person. One day, Satan came into God’s presence and God said “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?“ (Job 1:8). God allowed Satan to bother Job.  Job lost his children, possessions and health. He said “…The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord.“ (Job 1:21) Job’s friends came to comfort him. They sat in silence for 7 days. Job said “I know that my Redeemer lives “ (Job 19:25-27) and he trusted that God would save him one day.  The his friends started to lecture him and said that he had sinned and that was why all these terrible things had happened to him. Job said that he hadn’t sinned and justified himself more than God (Job 32:2). In the end, God answered Job and showed him that He is the Great Creator who has authority and wisdom and knowledge. Job repented, that is, he agreed that God was right and turned to God (Job 42:6). God blessed Job and gave him more than he had lost earlier.

Application: |
  When I am sick or something bad happens in my life, it doesn’t always mean that I sinned. Some bad things happen because of my disobedience but other bad things happen because we live in a sinful world where there is suffering. God allowed Satan to bother Job in order to demonstrate Job’s love for God. Job didn’t love God just because He had blessed him with riches and success but rather because God is worthy of praise.
  God is with us when we suffer. Jesus came and suffered for us and understands our difficulties.  I believe in Jesus because He is worthy and not just because He gives me things that I like. God loves me and I love Him too. I worship Him because He is God (wise, holy, great and loving). He gives me good things (a home, clothes, food etc) but even if He doesn’t give me these things, through Jesus, He  gives me treasures that can never be taken away: forgiveness, mercy, grace and hope etc. Also, Jesus is my Redeemer, as Job knew. He came and paid for my sin. One day, I will see Jesus face to face!
