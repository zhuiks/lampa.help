Truth: Jesus is Lord of all
Verse: Mk. 6:50 “...Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.”
Summary: |
  After Jesus fed the crowd of people, He sent His disciples over to the other side of the sea in their boats while He went to the mountain to pray. There was a strong wind on the sea and the disciples couldn’t row to shore. It was around 3am and Jesus came to them walking on the water. They thought that it was a ghost and were scared. Jesus said “it is I, do not be afraid!” “Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled.  For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.” (Mark 6:51-52)
Character:
- Jesus is God
- Jesus has authority over everything
- Jesus is Lord of all Creation
- Jesus knows the hearts of all
Application: |
  Many of the disciples were experienced fishermen and perhaps they thought that it wouldn’t be hard to row across the sea in their own strength. But without Jesus’ help, they couldn’t get to shore. I also can’t do anything without Jesus. Without Jesus everything will be hard and it seems like the wind is blowing against me. The disciples didn’t understand that they needed to give everything into Jesus’ hands (just as they gave the bread and the fish to Him and Jesus multiplied it). I also sometimes think that I can do something without Jesus’ help. This is a mistake. Jesus has authority over everything. He can walk on water. He can stop the wind. Jesus wanted the disciples to understand that they need Him. When Jesus appeared, they were afraid, but He told them to be encouraged (be of good cheer) and to not be afraid. He was with them! Once He was in the boat, the wind stopped.  __Jesus, teach me to turn to you for help and receive strength and wisdom from You. I am encouraged that You have control over everything. You tell me not to fear. You are with me. Thank you, Jesus!__
