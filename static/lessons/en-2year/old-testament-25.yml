Summary: |
  When Israel was traveling in the desert, king Balak saw them and was frightened. He told Balaam to curse them. God spoke to Balaam and from the beginning told him that he could not go to curse the people. Balak asked Balaam to come a second time and promised him a lot of money. During the night, God spoke to Balaam and told him that he could go with them but he could only say what God wanted and not what he wanted. In the morning, Balaam got on his donkey and went to king Balak. The donkey saw an angel with a sword ahead and started to go around him. Balaam didn’t see the angel and got mad at his donkey. The donkey wouldn’t go forward. God opened the mouth of the donkey and it spoke to Balaam! Later, God opened Balaam’s eyes and he saw the angel with the sword in the road ahead of him. The angel warned Balaam to say only the words that God told him. King Balak asked Balaam to curse Israel 3 times when they saw them from far away. But God gave Balaam words of blessing for Israel.

Application: |
  When I believe in Jesus, I belong to God and He is my help and defence (protection). Sometimes, people who don’t love God want to show that they are strong and they try to make us lower than they are. I can trust Jesus and know that He is my help and defence. He takes care of me and He sees everything that people do. Also, it’s important to not be like Balaam. He wanted to do things just to get money. He didn’t love God. Instead, he loved glory from people.
  Balaam spoke about a Star (a Ruler) that would come from the people of Israel. We know that this is Jesus. The Wisemen saw His star when He was born. Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords.
