Title: Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead
Book: 'The Gospels: The Manifestation of Christ.'
Scripture: Jn. 11:1-44
Truth: Jesus will resurrect us
Verse: Jn. 11:25 “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though
  he may die, he shall live.”
Summary: |
  Jesus heard that His friend Lazarus was sick and died. Jesus purposely didn’t come to Lazarus before he died because his sickness was for the glory of God (Jn. 11:4). Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha. Martha believed in Jesus and knew that He could do anything but she didn’t know if it was God’s will to raise Lazarus from the dead. Jesus told her that He is the Resurrection and the Life.
  Many people were with Mary and Martha to comfort them. Mary came to Jesus and said that Jesus could have prevented her brother’s death. Jesus saw how the sisters and others were crying about Lazarus’s death. He also cried (Jn. 11:35). Jesus went to the grave where Lazarus lay and asked them to remove the stone. Martha warned that there would be a bad smell because Lazarus had already been dead for 4 days. “Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” (Jn. 11:40). Jesus said in a loud voice “Lazarus, come out!” (Jn. 11:43) and Lazarus come out of the grave! Many people saw this miracle.

Application: |
  Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. He Himself rose from the dead. He also promises to raise me up after death (if I die before His Second Coming). This is why He said to Martha, “I am the resurrection and the life, he who believes in me though he may die, he shall live.” When believers in Jesus die, they have a hope that they will live again with Jesus in His Eternal Kingdom. If I have a friend or a relative who died, knowing Jesus, I will see them again. Jesus will raise up all people. Those who believe in Him will live forever, happy in paradise. Those who don’t believe in Him will be forever tormented in hell. This is why it is important to believe in Jesus! This is why it is important to tell people that Jesus gives eternal life. I don’t want to go to hell and don’t want anyone else to go there either.
  Also, in this story, I see that Jesus loved His friends and He was sad when they were having a hard time. He sees how the world has sin, sickness and death and how people suffer from this. He came to earth to conquer sin and death. Today, people still die but through faith in Jesus, there is the hope of resurrection and eternal life. I don’t have to fear death because for believers in Jesus, death is just crossing over into God’s presence.
  Just like the situation with Lazarus, sometimes Jesus decides not to heal someone now and allows them to die. But this doesn’t mean that He doesn’t love the person. Believers will be with Jesus after death and Jesus in His wisdom, knows when to take someone to be with Him in heaven. I can trust Jesus and know that He is wise and has good plans for me and other believers. __Jesus, you are my Hope!__
