Summary: |+
  Abram and Sarah didn’t wait for the son that God had promised them. Sarah told Abram to take Hagar, her servant as a second wife and to have a son through her. Hagar was pregnant with Ishmael and started to look down on Sarah. They didn’t get along and Hagar ran away. God spoke to her and said that her son would have a wild character. God promised to give her son, Ishmael, many descendants. Hagar returned to Sarah. In time, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. Later, Ishmael laughed at Isaac and God wanted Hagar and Ishmael to live separately from Isaac. It was difficult for them when they left. They cried. God heard them and helped them (Gen. 21:17-18). God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael.

Application: |
  It is better to trust God than to try to fulfill my plans in my way like Abram and Sarah did. This story shows me how God wants to give me His promises of love and grace by faith and not by my works. Ishmael reminds us of how we can try to do things in our own strength which is not pleasing to God. Isaac reminds us of how we receive God’s promise of grace. Jesus saves me by His grace just like He gave Abraham and Sara their son Isaac according to His promise. (see Gal 4).
  God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael. They are the great Arab people and today many of them are Muslim. God saw and heard Hagar and Ishmael when they were having a hard time. He saw and heard Abraham and Sarah when they were waiting for God’s promise to give them Isaac. Jesus sees and hears me when I pray to Him. Prov. 15:29 “The Lord is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.” When I believe in Jesus, He puts His righteousness on me and then I can be with God and He hears my prayers. God cares for me.
