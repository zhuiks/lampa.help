Summary: |
  Jesus taught the Word of God to people in a house. Many people came and it was so crowded that there wasn’t even room near the door. Four friends brought their paralyzed friend to Jesus but they couldn’t get in the door of the house. They decided to lower their friend down through the roof of the house! Jesus saw their faith and said “son, your sins are forgiven” The spiritual leaders were also there and were offended because only God can forgive sins and they didn’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus read their minds and asked them “what is easier to say: your sins are forgiven, or stand, take up your bed and walk! but that you would know that I have authority to forgive sins…He said to the paralyzed man “stand, take up your bed and walk!” The man stood and walked and all the people were amazed and praised God saying:”we have never seen anything like this before!”

Application: |
  Many people wanted to hear Jesus. Do I want to hear what Jesus says to me in the Bible? Jesus, help me to know you better. The four friends knew that Jesus could help their sick friend and brought him to Jesus. I also can bring my friends to Jesus, so they would know that He forgives sins and heals their wounds, pain and sadness. He wants to help the sick. The paralyzed man needed help, but really we all need help from Jesus. We all have sinned and need Him to forgive our sin. He wants to help me because He is loving and merciful.
  Jesus read the thoughts of the people that were with Him. He knows my thoughts and I can’t hide anything from Him. Jesus, help me to open my heart to you, so you would teach me to love You and believe in You. Jesus forgive my sin. I believe that You are the Son of God and can do anything.
  Jesus asked “what is easier…?” Maybe it’s easy to say that someone’s sins are forgiven because no one sees an immediate change. But when Jesus said “stand up and walk” it proved to people that He is God. Because He has authority, the man was healed and stood up. Jesus has authority to forgive sins and to heal sickness.
