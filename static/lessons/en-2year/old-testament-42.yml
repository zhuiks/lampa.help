Summary: |-
  Naaman was a famous successful soldier in the land of Israel’s enemies but he had a terrible skin disease. Once, he took captive a girl from Israel and she served his wife. The girl shared about a prophet in Israel who could help Naaman. The king of Syria wrote a letter to the king of Israel about Naaman but the king of Israel didn’t know how to help Naaman and was upset. The prophet Elisha heard about it and said that Naaman could come to him. Naaman came to Elisha on his chariot with lots of people and expensive gifts but the prophet didn’t even come out of his house to meet him and told him to wash seven times in the Jordan river.
  Naaman thought that this was foolish and simple. He didn’t want to do it but his servant said, that really what the prophet told him to do wasn’t hard. The prophet told him to wash and then he would be clean and healthy. Naaman washed seven times and on the seventh time, according to the Word of God, he became clean! He wanted to give Elisha a lot of presents but Elisha wouldn’t take anything from him. Naaman said that now he would only worship God. After this he started on his way home but Elisha’s servant Gehazi caught up to Naaman and lied to him so that he could get some presents from him. He got the gifts and hid them but God showed Elisha what Gehazi had done and gave the skin disease that had been on Naaman to him.

Application: |
  God showed grace and mercy to Naaman. He freely healed him. Elisha didn’t take gifts from Naaman so that he would understand this about God. Jesus freely saves me by His grace. I can’t do anything to deserve or earn His kindness. I can follow Elisha’s example and help people without expecting anything in return. I can follow the little girl’s example and tell people about the greatness of my God. I can also follow Naaman’s example and come to God for healing from sickness and for cleansing from sin.  But I better not follow Gehazi’s example, being sneaky and greedy. This is sin. God sees everything and I can never deceive Him. When I sin, I can ask forgiveness from Jesus and ask Him to help me to be honest, loving and giving. Jesus, help me to understand your grace that you freely give me.
