Application: |
  In this passage, people gave gifts to God. They wanted to say that all that they had was really from God and we give Him what already belongs to Him. They said thank you to Him for providing for them. Jesus saw that some people gave money but they didn’t really think that all that they had was God’s and belongs to Him. But God, that is, Jesus, saw the poor widow and said that even though she didn’t give much money, she actually gave more than the others because she gave out of her poverty and understood that all she had came from God and belongs to Him. She is a good example for me. I know that all I have is from God. I want to use everything for His glory. It’s not right to think that only a part of what I have belongs to God. Jesus, please show me how to use what You have given me. My toys money, clothes, home, time, strength and life is all from God. Jesus, show me how I can praise and thank You for all that You give. Maybe I can give some of my toys to someone. Maybe I can give some of my clothes to an orphanage. I want to have a thankful heart like that widow who trusted God with everything that she had. __Jesus, You gave all for me. You gave Your life for me. Thank you for Your love and care. Jesus, help me to see that everything is from You and help me to say thank you for everything and have a thankful heart.__
