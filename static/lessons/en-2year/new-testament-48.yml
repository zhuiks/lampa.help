Verse: Eph 6:10 “be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” or Eph 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.”
Summary: |-
  What is written in Acts about Ephesus: After Paul and a group of believers were in Philippi, they travelled to many cities and shared about Jesus. They were in Ephesus. The first time, Paul was there for a short time but other believers stayed there (Acts 18:18-21). Then he went back and was with the believers there for three years (Acts 20:31).

  The Letter to the Ephesians: Paul wrote a letter to the church while he was in prison (Eph 3:1, 4:1, 6:20). Most of the believers in the Ephesian church were Gentiles. (Eph. 2:11-22).

  Spiritual Blessings: In Jesus Christ, believers have every spiritual blessing in the heavens. That means that in Jesus, God gives believers: holiness, makes them His children, gives them forgiveness, promises them an inheritance in heaven and seals them with the Holy Spirit (1:1-14).
  
  Saved by Grace: “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast” (Eph 2:8-9). Earlier, we were all under the influence of sin and were God’s enemies. But now, in Jesus each believer is a new creation of God that fulfills the plans that God has for them. (Eph. 2:10)
  
  Unity in Christ: Jesus makes Jewish and Gentile believers one in Himself. They aren’t divided anymore. (Eph. 2:14-16) Jesus is the head of believers and they make up a body where each one does their part and grow in love. (Eph. 4:15-16)
  
  Believers love and respect one another: Believers should follow the example of Jesus. The Holy Spirit changes them (Eph. 4:20-24). “And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.” (Eph. 4:32). In all their relationships, believers should love and respect one another: husbands and wives, children and parents, workers and bosses. (Eph. 5:21-6:9)
  
  Jesus helps believers to stand in truth (and against the devil): Believers should, “be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” (Eph. 6:10) Jesus gives believers all that they need to stand safe in the truth (Eph. 6:10-20). Jesus gives believers protection (the armor of God). This protection is: truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation and the Word of God. All these help the believer to stand in the truth of their: 1)spiritual blessings 2)their salvation by grace 3) their unity with other believers in Christ 4) their love and respect for others.

  Jesus gives us all that we need to stand against the devil. Believers pray in the Spirit for one another that God would help them to boldly share the Good News of Jesus (Eph. 6:18-20).

Application: |-
  Jesus saved me and changes my life. I used to be far from God and was his enemy. Believers in Jesus believe that He is God, that He never sinned, that He fulfilled God’s law, that He took my punishment in my place for my disobedience, that He died and rose again, that He forgave my sin and gave me the Holy Spirit and that He loves me. Do I believe in Jesus? When I believe in Him, I love Him. When I love Him, I love other people, especially believers. When I believe in Him, I ask Him, He gives me strength to love Him and others and to resist evil.

  The picture of the armor of God shows me Jesus and my new life in Him.

  The belt of truth: Jesus and His ways are right. When I know Jesus and what pleases Him then that truth acts like a belt that helps my clothes to stay on right. When I know the truth, I won’t listen to the lies of the devil. What truth do I know from the Bible? (for example: Jesus is the Only Saviour and I have spiritual blessings in Jesus Eph 1:3 etc.)

  The breastplate of righteousness: Jesus is my righteousness. I am saved by grace and not by works (Eph 2:8). Knowing that Jesus is my righteousness works like a breastplate that protects my heart from wrong thoughts and pride. I remember that Jesus gave me salvation as a gift.

  Feet ready wearing the gospel of peace: Salvation and forgiveness in Jesus is good news! Jesus is the Saviour of all who believe and He gives us unity and peace in Him! (Eph. 2:17-22). I put on shoes to go somewhere more easily or faster. I want to know the good news about Jesus so I can be ready to share about Jesus and His love and salvation for all!

  The shield of faith: I believe that Jesus saved me and now I am a child of God. When I’m having a hard time, I can with faith boldly ask Jesus to help me and He will protect me like a shield and give me strength from the Holy Spirit to trust Him and know His love (Eph. 3:12, 16-19).

  The helmet of salvation: Jesus changes my thinking and my life. I love Jesus and want to live pleasing to Him. He helps me to put off the old way of life and start to live a new life in Christ. Just like a helmet protects the head, so salvation in Jesus protects my mind and His Spirit renews my thinking and my life (Eph. 4:23-24).

  The sword of the Spirit with is the Word of God: Jesus gave us the Bible, that is, the Word of God. When I believe what is written in the Word, then it works like a sword that protects from falsehood and helps me destroy sin in my life (Eph. 4:30-32).

  __Jesus, please help me to imitate You and as God’s beloved child to live in love as You loved us and gave Yourself for us (Eph. 5:1-2). Please fill me with the Holy Spirit, to love and respect other believers (Eph. 5:18-21). Please help me to stand in God’s power against the devil (Eph. 6:10). Jesus, help me and other believers to boldly share about Your salvation and love! (Eph. 6:18-20).__
