Summary: |
  There was not enough space for Abram and Lot’s herds to be together in the land. Even though Abram was older, he allowed Lot to choose the place where he wanted to live. Lot chose a beautiful green place in the east. He decided to live near an evil group of people. God promised to bless Abram and give him land and many descendants. Abram worshipped God.  The evil people where Lot lived fought and took Lot and his family captive. Abram heard about this and went out to save him. He saved him and then a priest-king named Melchizedek blessed Abram.

Application: |
  Just as Abram did, I can trust God, even when it seems that another person is getting something better than me. I can remember that knowing God is most important. It’s not worth it to chose something that looks nice but in reality is dangerous, like Lot did. Often sin looks nice but later we fall into slavery to it, like Lot became a slave. Jesus thank You that You save me from sin.  The priest-king named Melchizedek who blessed Abram reminds us of Jesus. Jesus is our High Priest and our King. He blesses us.
