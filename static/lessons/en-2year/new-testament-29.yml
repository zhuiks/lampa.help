Summary: |
  Jesus taught all the people. “Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, “This Man receives sinners and eats with them.” Jesus then told some parables. One of them was: “Then He said: “A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.” (Luke 15:11-13) Then when things were really bad for him, he said “I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,  and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’ But “when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.” And his father threw a part for his son “for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” (Luke 15:18-24) The father’s older son heard the party and complained to the father that he had never thrown a party for him even though he had always served his father. The father said ““And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.’” (Luke 15:31-32)

Application: |
  In His parable, Jesus tells about two sons who represent two kinds of people. The first is the younger son, who didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He took what he could from his father and lived his own way. But later he realized his mistake, repented and by his father’s mercy became a part of the family again. Maybe I am like this son? I want to live my own way and I don’t care what God says, what the Bible says and what people tell me about Jesus. There were a lot of people like that who repented and started to trust God and follow Him in the time when Jesus lived on the earth. They were spiritually dead and far from God but through faith in Jesus they became spiritually alive and close to God. I also can come to the Heavenly Father through faith in Jesus and know that He receives me. I can tell people about Jesus’ love and tell them that God wants to forgive their sin and give them eternal life.
  But maybe I’m more like the second son. He also didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He just did what he was suppose to do out of obligation or duty. He thought that he deserved a party because he was obedient but he didn’t know his father. He didn’t want his younger brother to find the father’s mercy and love. He thought that only he, who had lived right should get what was good. He didn’t know the loving heart of his father and he wasn’t glad when his brother who had been “dead” became “alive”. In the time when Jesus lived on the earth there were Pharisees who knew God’s law and fulfilled it well. They thought that they deserved good things from the Heavenly Father. They complained when “sinners” ate with Jesus and He talked with them. They weren’t glad when people who had been “dead” and far from God started to come to God through Jesus and became “alive”. Maybe I also live right and think that I deserve good things from God because of “my righteousness”? In reality, all people sin and everyone needs the righteousness of Jesus to be part of God’s family. Why do I listen to God or my parents or do what is right? Love and thankfulness towards God the Father give me a desire to obey God. When I see the loving heart of God, I want to call everyone to Him so that they would also draw near to God and join the party that God has planned for all those who love Jesus, those that He loves so much!
