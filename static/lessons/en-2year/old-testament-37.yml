Application: |
  God offers wisdom to us. Rehoboam didn’t listen to wise counsel and so the kingdom broke away from him.  When God gives me responsibility, I should trust in Him and not think that I can do things my way.
  The book of Proverbs says that there are two roads in life: God’s road which leads to life and the world’s road which leads to death. God wants to give us His wisdom and His life. Jesus is the Way the Truth and the Life (Jn. 14:6).
  Jeroboam set up idols. God wants us to worship Him alone. He is the most important, not I and not what the world calls important. Jesus calls me to follow Him. He wants to be the King of my heart and have the authority in my life. __Jesus, help me to follow You, my King, and to not be prideful and do things my own way. Help me to listen and learn from Your Word. Please give me your wisdom. __
