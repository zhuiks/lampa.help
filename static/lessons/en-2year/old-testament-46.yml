Summary: |
  After many years a different king, Darius, ruled and Daniel continued to serve. The king was thinking about making Daniel head over the kingdom. There were some people who envied Daniel and wanted to get rid of him. But Daniel was a god-fearing person and they couldn’t find anything bad in him. Then they made a plan and gave the king an idea to make a law that for 30 days, people could only pray to the king (not to God). But Daniel loved God and continued to pray to God alone even when he heard about the law. The tricky people caught Daniel when he was praying and as a punishment threw him into the lion’s den.  The king wanted to free Daniel but he couldn’t change his law. He said “may your God save you!” That night, the king couldn’t sleep and in the morning he came to the lion’s den to see if Daniel was still alive. Daniel said “God sent an angel who closed the mouth of the lions.” God saved Daniel because he believed in God. Later, the king commanded that all people in his kingdom should fear God and know that He saves.

Application: |
  Daniel served before many different kings when he lived in Babylon. He saw that their kingdoms were only for a time. He knew that God is the great King and that His kingdom was forever. He followed God above all and did not compromise when man’s law contradicted (went against) God’s law. God showed Daniel that the Messiah’s kingdom would never end (Dan. 2:44) and showed him what would happen before Jesus’ kingdom was fully established (Dan. 9).
  It may happen that evil people don’t like me and want to get me into trouble. I can trust God and follow Him like Daniel did. Even if they do something bad to me, Jesus is with me and I know that I belong to Him and His kingdom. Earthly kingdoms will all end someday, but Jesus’ kingdom is forever.
