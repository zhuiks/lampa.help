Summary: |
  Jesus was with His disciples when a crowd of people followed Him. They knew that He did miracles and wanted to be with Him.
  “Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?”  But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.  Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.”  One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,  “There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?” (Jn. 6:5-9)
  Jesus told the disciples to help the people to sit down. He took the bread and the fish, thanked the Heavenly Father and gave out the food to the people. Everyone was filled and there were even 12 baskets of food leftover. Jesus said to His disciples“Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.” (Jn. 6:12). All the people saw the miracle and believed that Jesus was the Prophet of whom Moses had spoken for whom they were waiting. Then they wanted to make Jesus their king, but He left.

Application: |
  Jesus knew the needs of the people and He had a plan to help them. He knows my needs and can help me. For Jesus, nothing is impossible. Jesus took care of people’s physical needs. He also takes cares of people’s spiritual needs. Everyone needs to eat (bread) to live. But everyone also needs friendship with God in order to live. I need to be reconciled to God through faith in Jesus in order to have life. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and forgives my sin, He gives me new life with God. Jesus took very little bread and fish and fed a lot of people. It’s not important what I have (little or much). It is important that I give what I have into Jesus’ hands so that He would be glorified and do what He wants to with it. People followed after Jesus because they saw His miracles and not because they believed that He was God’s Son. Why do I follow Jesus? Do I want something from Jesus or do I just want to be with Him because I understand that He is the Savior, the King and the Most Important?__ Jesus, help me to love You more. Thank you Jesus that you are caring and loving. Thank you that You died for me and give me life in You when I trust You.__
