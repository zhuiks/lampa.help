Summary: |
  God created Adam and Eve in His image. He created Eve to be a helper to Adam. He gave him a garden and all the trees, but forbid him to eat from one tree (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil). Satan, in the form of a snake*, deceived Eve and she ate the fruit from the forbidden tree and gave some to Adam to eat. Right away, they knew they were guilty and hid from God. They covered themselves with leaves (as clothing) but God covered their guilt with the skin of an animal. God made them leave the garden but promised to send a Saviour through a child of a woman (Gen. 3:15).

  *see Rev. 12:9"

Character: 
  God is holy. He punishes sin. God is Saviour. Only God can cover and take away our sin.

Application: |
  God made me in His image! What does this mean? It means that because God is the Creator, I like to create, because God is Spirit, I am spiritual, because God is the Communicator, I communicate, because God has a Reason and Feelings, I think and feel, because God is Relational, I have relationships.*

  God is so good and gave me life. It’s right that I would love Him most of all, worship Him and follow all that He says, obeying Him. Eve listened to the serpent’s lie and she didn’t trust God’s words. I should not listen to the lie, if someone says that God’s Word is not true or right.

  Adam and Eve sinned. What does this mean? Sin is when we love something or someone else more than God. Sin is a heart condition. In my own strength, I can’t love God most of all. I need help.God helped Adam and Eve when He covered them with the skin of an animal to show them that sin leads to death and that sin must be paid for with a Life. He promised them a Saviour and God fulfilled His promise by sending Jesus to save us. Because of Adam and Eve’s sin, all people became sinful from birth. But through faith in Jesus, I can be born again from above and Jesus gives me His righteousness. Rom. 5:19 says, “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.” I need a Saviour, I need Jesus. I need to ask God to forgive my sins. Jesus never sinned and so He could take the punishment for my sin upon Himself. He rose to life and so He conquered sin and death.I thank God for the death and resurrection of Jesus.
