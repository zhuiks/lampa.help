Summary: |-
  Jesus ate with His friends. He loved them and washed their feet. one of them (Judas Iscariot) betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill him. Jesus explained to the disciples that He would die for them soon and gave them bread that symbolized His body and wine that symbolized His blood. He also told Peter that he would deny Jesus 3 times. Peter didn’t believe it.

  At night, Jesus and His friends prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. But the disciples fell asleep. Jesus prayed to the Father and said, “let it be: not how I want it to be, but how You want it to be: (Matt. 26:39)

  Judas Iscariot came with people and they took Jesus. They led Him to judgement before the religious leaders and to the Roman governor, Pilate. They wanted to kill Him, because He said that He is the Son of God, but they didn’t believe that He is the Son of God. Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent, but was afraid of the opinion of people and gave the order to crucify Jesus. At the time of the judgement, Peter denied Jesus 3 times, just like Jesus said. Peter cried. The soldiers treated Jesus very rudely; they hit Him and laughed at Him.

  Jesus hung on the cross between 2 criminals. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised him that he would be with Him in paradise that day. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the curtain in the temple tore from top to bottom. Jesus said “It is finished!” (Jn.19:30) He died.

  The disciples saw that Jesus was buried in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it. On the third day, just as He said, Jesus rose again! The women came to anoint His body, but they saw angels that told them that He rose. A couple of disciples ran to the tomb and saw that He wasn’t there but they didn’t understand that He was alive. Some of the disciples saw the Risen Jesus right near the tomb.

  Later, Jesus appeared to the other disciples in a new glorified body. He brought Peter back into close friendship with him after he had denied Him. He ate with His friends, spoke with them and gave them the Holy Spirit. He forgives the sins of all who trust Him. Jesus said, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” Luke 24:46-47.
