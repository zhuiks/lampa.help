  “Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.  For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.  “What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.  Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.” (Matt. 18:10-14)

Application: |
  Jesus says that I have an angel that always sees the face of God. Jesus watches over me. Jesus came to earth to save me and all people who believe in Him. Without Jesus, I am like a lost sheep, who lost its way in the mountains. Without Jesus’ help, I will perish. But He seeks me and wants me to be a part of His flock so He can care for me always. How does He seek me? When I hear stories about Jesus, when I hear songs about Jesus, when people talk about Jesus, He calls me to Himself in those and many other ways. Through all those things, He reveals Himself to me so that I would come to Him. When I believe in Jesus, then He receives me into His kingdom where there is joy, peace and love. I can tell others about Jesus so that they would come to Him and know that Jesus is Saviour. Maybe they don’t know that life without Jesus is very dangerous.  I can tell them that Jesus wants to care for them, forgive their sin and receive them into His heavenly kingdom. Jesus, help me to tell people, my relatives, neighbors and friends that You want to and you can save them. This is your will, that people wouldn’t perish. (see also John 3:16)
