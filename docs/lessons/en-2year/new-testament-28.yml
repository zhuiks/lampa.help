Summary: |
  Once, a person asked Jesus “what do I need to do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus asked him what the Scriptures say. The person answered correctly: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’ But then he asked “who is my neighbor?” Jesus answered with the following story: Once a man was travelling on the road and thieves robbed him and beat him. He lay there, wounded on the road. Later, a priest walked by and saw him but didn’t stop to help him. The next person was a Levi. He also passed by and didn’t help the wounded man lying on the road. The third person was a Samaritan. He helped him and paid for his treatment to get better.
  Jesus then asked, which of the three people was a neighbor to the wounded man. The answer was, the one who showed him mercy. Jesus said, go and do the same.

Application: |
  The person asked Jesus a question. I too can ask God questions and know that answers are found in the Bible. The person wanted to have eternal life. How can I know if I will live eternally with Jesus? Do I love God? Can I love Jesus more? How? In Jesus’ parable, two Jewish people didn’t stop to help the Jewish man who was hurt. Do I sometimes not help my friends or my parents? Why don’t I help? Maybe I’m in a hurry? Many it’s inconvenient? Maybe I’m afraid?
  Then the Samaritan, who historically wasn’t friends with the Jews, decided to stop and help the man. Samaritans and Jews were enemies, but he helped him. Which people groups today don’t really like one another? What does God want me to do when I see that my “enemy” is suffering?
  Jesus loved me when I was still a sinner and His enemy (Rom. 5:10). He died for me and for all people in the world. Jesus loved me and now I love Jesus and am thankful to Him for salvation and forgiveness and eternal life, I want to love others and show them Jesus’ love. __God, help me to love You and my neighbor. Show me how to love more and give me boldness and strength to love when it is hard.__
