Summary: |+
  God had brought the people back from captivity, as He promised.”When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. Then our mouth was filled with laughter,And our tongue with singing” (Ps 126:1-2).
  Malachi told the people that God loved them, but that they weren’t loving God. They were not worshipping God with their whole hearts, some of the leaders weren’t being honest, some of the priests weren’t sharing God’s truth with the people and some of the men were not being nice to their wives.  God reminded them that He is a great King and said that,“For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; In every place incense shall be offered to My name, And a pure offering; For My name shall be great among the nations,says the Lord of hosts.” (Malachi 1:11)
  Malachi shared God’s promises to send a messenger (John the Baptist) who would prepare the way for the Messiah (Jesus), who is also a messenger of the New Covenant (new relationship between God and people). The Messiah will be like fire and soap that cleans and refines people. He will judge people. God calls people to return to Him. He promises to bless them when they live for Him completely and trust Him with all they have.
  Some people who feared (loved and respected) God made a book of remembrance and wanted to listen to and follow God. God called them His special treasure. God promised to come one day to judge the earth and to save those who love Him: ”But to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings” (Mal. 4:2). Again, God promised to send Elijah before He comes to judge the earth.

  Looking at prophecy can sometimes be like looking at mountains that are far away. At first, it seems like all the peaks are lined up together in the same place. In reality, some of the mountain peaks are closer to us and some are farther away. In Malachi, his words were for the people that heard him speak, but they also are for us now. Some of these words already took place when God sent John the Baptist as the messenger to prepare the way for Jesus to come. Jesus says that John was like the Elijah that Malachi wrote about (Malachi 4:5, Matt 17:11-13) but that Elijah will come again before God judges the earth. These words are like two different mountain peaks. They look like they are in the same place, but they are for different times.
  Jesus came to bring us the New Covenant. By grace He saves us, through faith in Him. This last book of the Old Testament points to Jesus coming to save all people and bring the message of salvation and of judgement. Jesus saves all who trust in Him. He will judge all who do not trust in Him. Jesus is coming again!
  Psalm 126 speaks about the people’s joy in returning to Israel: “He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.” (Ps. 126:6). I can share with people that Jesus is Saviour to those who trust Him and that He is Judge to those who do not trust Him. This can be like planting seeds. It is not easy to tell people the truth and sometimes they don’t like what they hear. But after the seeds are planted, God makes it grow and people gather what they planted and are happy. In the same way, God makes His Word bring life to people’s hearts when they believe in Jesus. There is a harvest of people gathered to Jesus. This is very joyful! Lord Jesus, use me to share with people that you are Saviour. You said: “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. __Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matt 9:37). You are coming soon, Lord Jesus. Help me to love you with all my heart, soul and strength and to share your love and salvation with people.__
