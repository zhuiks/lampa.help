Summary: |
  Twelve spies, one from each tribe, went to survey the promised land for 40 days. They saw that it was VERY good. God promised to lead them into the land but ten of the spies were afraid and gave the people a bad report. The people refused to follow where God was leading them to go. Only Joshua and Caleb told the people to trust God and to go into the land. God said that now the people had to stay in the desert for 40 years and all the people who didn’t trust God would die before the rest of the people could go into the promised land. Some people decided to go into the land on their own without God’s help but they were attacked by the people of the land.

Application: |
  God wanted to lead the people into a good land where they could have rest. But the people didn’t trust God. Jesus wants to give me a special kind of rest for my heart. I can trust Him. When I am afraid of people or of some new place, I can know that God is with me. If God is leading me to go there, He will help me there. When I don’t listen to God, I miss an opportunity to be with Him, which is true happiness. __Jesus, help me to trust you so I won’t miss the good things that You have planned for me.Thank you for the rest that you give my heart in knowing You.__
