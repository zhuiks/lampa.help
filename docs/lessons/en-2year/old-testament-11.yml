Summary: |
  Jacob and Esau were twins. Even before they were born, God said that Jacob would be stronger or have a more important place than Esau (Gen. 25:23). One day, Jacob tricked Esau into giving him the birthright (special rights for the 1st born son) for a bowl of soup. Esau chose to have the soup.  Later, when their father Isaac was old, he wanted to bless Esau (the firstborn) in a special way. Esau left to hunt special food for his father. Their mother, Rebekah, told Jacob to dress up like Esau and he deceived his father into giving him the special blessing. Esau was very angry with Jacob when he found out what happened.
  See also: 2 Cor. 7:10 “For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death”
  Heb. 12:16b-17 “…profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.”
Character:

Application: |
  God has a good plan for me that He will make happen in His time and in His way. His way is best. Jacob didn’t wait for God’s timing and God’s way.  Jacob did things his own way and didn’t trust God in order to get what God had promised. Jacob deceived his family and hurt them by what he did. I don’t want to be deceitful and try to get something from people. __God, help me to be honest. God, you see everything that is in my heart. You see everything that I do and hear everything that I say. Help me to do things your way, Jesus, even if it means waiting.__
  Esau didn’t think that his future and his place in the family were more important than the soup that he wanted at the moment. Do I sometimes want something “right now!” and not think about what will happen later? Later, when Jacob received the blessing from their father, Esau was sad and mad that he had been tricked but he wasn’t sad that he gave his birthright away to Jacob for that bowl of soup. He didn’t repent (see Heb 12:16b-17). To repent means to agree that I did something wrong and start to go a new direction: God’s direction. Rom.2:4 says that ”…the goodness of God leads you to repentance” When I think about how Jesus died for me, how He rose again, how He wants to forgive me and change my heart, I see His goodness and I want to repent (to start to go God’s way). __Jesus, forgive me when I act like Jacob and try to get something in my own way. Forgive me when I act like Esau and don’t think about what is more important than what I want at the moment. Help me to go your way, Jesus and not my own way. Thank you that you give me your Holy Spirit to help me.__
