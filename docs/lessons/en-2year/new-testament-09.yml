Summary: |
  A group of people was crowding Jesus because they wanted to hear what He was teaching. This was near the sea and Jesus asked Peter if He could teach from his boat. Afterwards, Jesus asked Peter to row farther from the shore and throw his net into the deep waters. Peter said that they had worked all night to catch fish and hadn’t caught anything. But Peter acted according to Jesus’ Words and threw his net into the deep. When he did, he caught so many fish that his boat started to sink! Peter fell on his knees before Jesus and said “go away from me Lord, for I am a sinner.” Jesus said “don’t fear, from now on you will be a fishers of men.” (Luke 5:8,10)
  Peter, James and John left everything and followed after Jesus.
  After this, Jesus spent the night in prayer with God the Father. On the next day, Jesus called the 12 disciples who would fellowship closely with Him and follow Him.

Application: |
  Jesus did a miracle when He brought many fish into the fisherman’s net. He told the fishermen that they would be fishers of men. He meant that just as fishermen catch fish and bring them to shore, now Jesus would help them to bring people to God. Now they would tell people about Jesus so that people would come out of the meaninglessness of the world and come to Jesus for Life. I also want to tell people about Jesus, so that they wouldn’t live in the world their own way, but would have life in Jesus. Peter and his friends left everything to follow Jesus. Following Jesus is the most important thing. Jesus calls me to be with Him always and live every day with Him, God’s way. __Jesus, help me to know you better, to love You and to follow you every day. Make me a fisher of men and use me to bring many people into your kingdom! __
