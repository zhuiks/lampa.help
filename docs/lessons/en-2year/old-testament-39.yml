Summary: |
  There had already been drought in the land for three years. God told Elijah to return to Israel and talk with king Ahab. He gathered all the people and the prophets of Baal (a false god) on Mount Carmel. He said that they would see who the true God is. The people who worshipped Baal would bring a sacrifice to him and Elijah would sacrifice to God. The God who answered with fire from heaven was the true God. The prophets of Baal cried out to him all day long but nothing happened. Then Elijah gathered the people near the altar, dug a ditch around it and poured water over the altar three times until the water filled the ditch. He prayed to God and asked Him to show the people that He is the Only God. God answered with fire from heaven and all the people fell on their faces and cried out “the Lord, He is God!” Then they killed the false prophets.

Application: |
  I know that God is the Only God and the One way of salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ. God used Elijah to show people that He is God. He can use even me to show people that Jesus is God. Even if I am the only one in a crowd of people who believes in Jesus, I can be sure that God is with me and He alone is worthy of worship.
