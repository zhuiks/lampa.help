Summary: |
  Moses was on the mountain for 40 days and received the law. When he was there, Aaron and the people decided to make a golden calf and worship it. God told Moses what the people had done. Moses came down the mountain and broke the tablets with the 10 commandments. God wanted to destroy the people for their idol worship but Moses prayed to God and He didn’t destroy them but He punished them. Later, Moses returned to the mountain and again wrote the 10 commandments on the tablets.  God declared His name to Moses (Ex. 34:6) and the people saw that his face shone after talking with God and he wore a veil when he spoke to the people (Ex. 34:29,35).

Application: |
  The people made an idol and worshipped it. An idol could be a statue, but it could also be anything that I love and serve instead of God. It is anything that I put higher than God in my heart and in my life. I want to love God more than anyone or anything. Jesus helps me to love God. Is something or someone more important to me than God? If so, I can ask God for forgiveness and ask Him to change my heart. I need help from God to live the way that God’s wants. Jesus helps me to live for God and love God more than anything else. God’s Word shows me what is right and true. I can read the Bible to know God and his truth.__ Jesus, show me by your Holy Spirit if I love anything or anyone more than you. Please help me to remove that idol and worship you alone.__
