Summary: |
  Seven of Jesus’ disciples went fishing. Jesus stood on the shore and asked if they had caught any fish. They answered that they hadn’t caught any. He told them to throw their net on the other side and when they did, they suddenly caught a great number of fish. John recognized Jesus on the shore. Peter jumped out of the boat and swam to Jesus. Jesus had already prepared breakfast for them.
  Later, Jesus and Peter talked. Jesus asked him “… do you love Me more than these?” He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Feed My lambs.” Jesus asked Peter two more times and the last time, Peter answered “Lord! You know everything. You know that I love You.” (Jn. 21:15, 17)

Application: |
  Jesus knew where His disciples would be and what they were doing. He met them and helped them miraculously. The miracle with the fish is just like the miracle at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry on earth. He cared for the disciples and prepared breakfast for them. Jesus always knows where I am and what I am doing. He knows my needs. He is my help. He cares for me.
  Earlier, when Peter was scared, he said three times that he didn’t know Jesus. He was sad and Jesus knew that. Jesus talked separately with Peter and asked Peter three times if he loved Him. Jesus reconciled Peter to Himself. Peter had the opportunity to tell Jesus that He loved Him and understand that Jesus forgave his sin. When I sin, I am not loving Jesus. __Jesus, please forgive me of my sin and help me love You more than anything or anyone else.__
  Jesus wanted Peter to care for others when He said to him “feed my lambs.” Jesus gives me love for Him and others. Jesus, please show me how to love those around me. There are many people who don’t know about Jesus’ love and care. I can tell them how they can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit who strengthens me and pours out God’s love in my heart so I can share about Jesus (Rom 5:5).
