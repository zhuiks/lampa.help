Summary: |
  God gave Abram and Sarah new names and promised that they would be father and mother of many nations. He said that they would have a son. Sarah laughed when she heard the news. God gave Abraham and Sarah a son, just as He promised them and they named him Isaac, which means laughter. God told Abraham to bring Isaac to Him as a sacrifice. Abraham trusted God. At the last minute, God gave a ram in place of Isaac and said that Abraham should not sacrifice his son.
Character:
- God is faithful
- He fulfills His promises
- He is merciful
- He is wise
- God provides
- Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
Application: |
  God always keeps His promises. He made big promises to Abraham and Sarah and He kept them.  I can trust God. I believe that He saves me by His grace when I believe in Jesus. God provided Abraham with the ram for the sacrifice instead of Isaac just as He provided Jesus as the sacrifice for our sin instead of me being punished for my sin. I thank God that He gave us Jesus who died instead of me. I believe that Jesus’ sacrifice paid for my sin. I believe that the righteousness of Jesus is necessary for my salvation.
  Abraham trusted God with his son, who was precious to him. God wants us to trust Him with all that is important and valuable to us. Hebrews 11:17-19 says that Abraham was ready to sacrifice Isaac because he believed that God would raise him from the dead afterwards. I also believe that it’s good when I give to God whatever He asks me to give to Him. Somehow, He will bring life out of that sacrifice. Jesus died, but He rose again and now because of His death and resurrection, I have life in Him! God has provided eternal life to me, through faith in Jesus.
