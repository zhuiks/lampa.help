Summary: |
  An angel of the Lord told Philip to go on the road to Gaza, which was empty. On that road, Philip saw an Ethiopian in a chariot and the Spirit told Philip to go up to him. He heard the Ethiopian reading Isaiah. Phillip asked him if he understood what he was reading. The Ethiopian asked him to explain the passage. “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him. Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “See, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?” Then Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God” (Acts 8:35-37). The Ethiopian was baptized and was glad. Then God took Phillip and he appeared in another city. He shared with people about Jesus and went to Caesarea.

Application: |
  Phillip told people about Jesus everywhere. He was ready to listen to the Holy Spirit. I also want to tell people about salvation in Jesus. I also want to be obedient to God when He tells me to do something. Maybe Phillip didn’t understand why God wanted Him to go down an empty road but he trusted God and went. God knew that the Ethiopian was there reading scripture and seeking the truth. Phillip was given the privilege of telling the Ethiopian about Jesus.
  Phillip knew the Word of God well and helped people to see what the Word says about salvation in Jesus. I also want to know the BIble so that I can know Jesus better, love Him more and tell people about Him. See also 2 Tim 4:2, 1 Pet. 3:15 about being ready to share about Jesus.
  Phillip was a Jew and the Ethiopian was from a different people group. Philip knew that Jesus is the Saviour of all people. I know that Jesus is the Saviour of all peoples and I want to share about Him not only with people from my group but with all those that God wants me to share with.
  The Ethiopian was seeking God. He didn’t know about Jesus but he knew that the Word of God was important and he worshipped God. God revealed Himself to him and he came to know Jesus! He was ready to be baptized when he saw water. He wanted to show his faith in Jesus and identify himself with the death and resurrection of Jesus to show that he received forgiveness from Jesus and that by His grace he was given new life (see Rom. 6:1-11). __Jesus, I want to know you more. Help me to understand Your Word, to grow in my love for you and to worship You with my life. Help me to understand how baptism shows others how believers have died to the old self and have new life in You. Jesus, You are the Saviour of all people all over the world. Please save more people and use me to tell people about Your Love and salvation.__
