  Moses grew up in Pharaoh’s palace and later wanted to save his Hebrew people. He killed an Egyptian while trying to defend a Hebrew slave and then ran away. He lived in another country for 40 years and worked as a shepherd. One day, God appeared to Moses in a burning bush and told him that He would save the Israelites from slavery. God promised to save His people. Moses was afraid but God promised to help him and showed him His strength and His presence through special signs (miracles).
