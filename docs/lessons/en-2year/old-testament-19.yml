Summary: |
  In a miraculous way, God made a pathway through the sea for the people to cross over to a safe place. All of Pharaoh’s soldiers who were chasing after the Israelites drowned in the sea. After this, the people went into the wilderness and wanted to eat and drink. God did miracles and gave them water to drink and every morning, He gave them “bread” (manna) from heaven. They gathered the manna every morning except for the Sabbath (for them, Saturday) morning. On the Sabbath morning they rested because God gave them a double portion of manna the day before. He also sent them birds (pheasants) to eat when they wanted meat. The Israelites often complained to God and to Moses.
Character:
- God is Saviour

- ' He is wonderful (He does miracles.)'
- He is faithful
- God takes care of our needs
- He is generous and gives us all that we need
- He is our source for everything and has everything under control
Application: |
  Even when it seems like there is no hope, God is strong to help and save us. It looked like the people of Israel were trapped by the sea, but God made a way and saved them! Jesus makes a way for me when there is no hope. He helps me and saves me.
  The people complained to God because they didn’t believe that He was good or that He would help them. This grumbling and complaining was a sin but God in His mercy took care of their needs. I can ask Him for help and believe that He is good and generous and will take care of my needs. God, please forgive me when I complain about… Jesus, help me to ask for your help and trust You instead of complaining.   I can trust God knowing that He knows my needs and loves it when I turn to Him for help. God hears my prayers and He is my help.
  Jesus is compared to manna (bread from heaven) and the rock that Moses struck (from which water came for the people). Jesus was struck (He died on the cross) in order to give us life. The manna and the rock are pictures to reminds us that Jesus gives us spiritual life. Bread and water are necessary for physical life. Jesus is necessary for spiritual life. __Thank you Jesus, for the life I have in You!__
