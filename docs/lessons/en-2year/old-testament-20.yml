Application: |
  God has made known to me his standard of holiness through his law but I myself in my own strength cannot fulfill the law. I am guilty of breaking God’s law and that’s why I need Jesus. Jesus fulfilled the law for me and when I believe in Him, He gives me his strength to live God’s way. He took my punishment for breaking God’s law when He died on the cross. When I believe in Him, He gives me His Holy Spirit that helps me to love and follow God. Jesus gives me His righteousness. I don’t have righteousness of my own.  __Jesus, please help me to love God and live pleasing to Him.__
