Summary: |-
  The Israelites were slaves in Egypt. Pharaoh gave an order to kill every Hebrew baby boy because the Egyptians were afraid that the Hebrew people would grow strong and turn against them. The Hebrew midwives refused to kill the babies. Moses’ parents hid him and later placed him in a basket, so that he would float down the river. Pharaoh’s daughter found him and decided to adopt him. She hired Moses’ own mother to take care of him for her.
  See also Hebrews 11:23 “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command.”
Character:
- God is Saviour
- God sees everything
- God is our help
Application: |
  When everything is against me, God is my help and my salvation. When I am afraid, God is with me and He is strong. God can help even when it seems impossible! I can trust God and with His help do what is pleasing to Him even when other people are not doing things God’s way (like the midwives and Moses’ parents did).
  Jesus is my help and salvation. I am helpless without Him and the life and forgiveness that He offers to all who believe in Him. Moses reminds us of Jesus because his life was threatened when he was a baby. However, God fulfilled His plan through him.
