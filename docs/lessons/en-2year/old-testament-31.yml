Summary: |
  1 Sam. 14: Jonathan trusted God and decided to fight against the enemy with his armor bearer (his helper in battle). They were only two but he said “nothing restrains the Lord from saving by many or by few” (1 Sam.14:6). God gave victory. Saul heard the sound of battle and started to seek God’s will. But he did not wait and gave orders for the soldiers to fight and for them not to eat until they won. Jonathan didn’t hear his father’s command and ate honey. He said that his father made trouble by giving such a command.  Later, when Saul again sought God’s will, God didn’t answer. Saul wanted to know who was guilty and God showed that it was Jonathan. Saul found out and wanted to kill him but the soldiers saved Jonathan.
  1 Sam.18:1-4 Later, when Jonathan saw David’s bravery, he met him and gave him his armor as a special gift. He was a faithful friend to David all of his life.

- He is faithful to save us
- God gives victory
Application: |
  Jonathan trusted God and knew that He saves people. I can trust God too and He can use me to tell people about salvation in Jesus (whatever my age is).
  Jonathan didn’t respect his father when he answered disrespectfully about the command to not eat. God wants to give me a heart that loves and respects my parents. Jesus gives me this heart when I trust in Him.
  Jonathan gave a special gift to David. I too can give a special gift to friends. Jesus is my faithful friend. He gave the greatest gift ever; He gave His life for me. He helps me to be a faithful friend to others.
