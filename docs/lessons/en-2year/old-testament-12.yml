Summary: |
  In Gen. 28:10-22 through Gen. 30:24, Jacob leaves his family because he is afraid that his brother will hurt him. He goes to his mom’s relatives who live far away. On the way there, God speaks to Jacob, showing him a ladder going from heaven to earth and promises to give Jacob the land that He promised to Abraham and to be with Jacob. Jacob goes to live with his uncle Laban, who tricks Jacob into marrying his older daughter instead of the younger daughter that he promised him. Jacob marries the younger daughter too. He takes 2 more wives. God gives Jacob many children.
  Gen 31-33: Jacob and his family leave Laban without saying goodbye. Laban was angry and ran after Jacob but God protected Jacob. Jacob was going back to the land where his parents were and was afraid to see his brother, Esau. At night, an angel wrestled with Jacob.  God gave him a new name and touched his hip so that it would be weak. Jacob and Esau met and they hugged each other. Jacob and his family found a place to live and Jacob built an altar to worship God.
  See also: Hosea 12:3-4 “He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he struggled with God.Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him in Bethel, and there He spoke to us.”
Character:
- God is with us
- God is faithful
- God keeps his Word
- God is my protector and my help
- God is stronger than I am
- God has good plans for me
- Jesus came from heaven to earth to connect us to God (like the ladder in Jacob’s
  dream)
Application: |
  God is with me. God fulfills His promises to me. What promises are in the Bible? In Jesus, He promises to love me, forgive my sin, bring me to heaven to live with him, give me the Holy Spirit for wisdom, help, strength and comfort. I trust Jesus. When I am afraid, I can ask Jesus for help and He helps me just like He helped Jacob when he was afraid of meeting his brother.
  Jacob wrestled with God and He gave him a new name and touched his hip so that Jacob would never forget that God is stronger. God didn’t want Jacob to try to do things in his own strength.  Jacob started to trust God.  I can ask God for help. I don’t want to try to do things in my own strength. I don’t have enough strength; God always has enough strength!
  God wants a husband to have only one wife (Gen 2:24). Jacob had many wives and because of that there was jealousy and envy in the family. This was not pleasing to God. God gave Jacob many children. This was part of the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18) and Isaac (Gen. 26:4).
