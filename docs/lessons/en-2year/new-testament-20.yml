Summary: |
  Jairus was a leader in the synagogue and asked Jesus to come to his house and heal his 12 year old daughter, who was dying. A crowd of people followed Jesus and along the way, a certain woman, who had been very sick for 12 years touched the edge of Jesus’ clothes, believing that He could heal her. She was instantly healed. He asked who touched Him but His question amazed people because many people were crowding around and touching Jesus as they walked along the road. But He knew that the woman had touched Him with faith. She told Jesus that it was her and He told her that now she was not only physically healed but that He forgave her sin and gave her a healthy soul.
  Just then people came and said that Jairus’s daughter had died but Jesus said to her father “do not fear! Only believe!” (Luke 8:50). At Jairus’s house, Jesus allowed only the parents and 2 of his disciples to be in the room. Jesus told the girl to get up and He raised her up! She came alive! Jesus said that they should feed her and her parents were so glad. Jesus told them not to tell anyone about the miracle that He did.

Application: |
  Jairus and the woman in the crowd both knew that Jesus could help them. Their circumstances were very difficult and doctors couldn’t help them. But for Jesus nothing is impossible. He is my hope and my help. In difficult or simple circumstances, I can turn to Jesus for help. Jesus told Jairus “do not fear, only believe!” Jesus speaks these words to me too.__ Jesus, help me to trust You and to boldly come to You for help.__
  Jesus gave the woman physical health and the little girl physical life. But He also forgives sins and gives spiritual life. He can give me a heart that loves God more than anything and anyone. He can help me to live close to Him and make me very happy in Him. Jesus didn’t boast or brag when He did miracles. He didn’t turn the attention towards Himself because He has a humble heart. When I do something good, it was Jesus who helped me to do it. He sees it and I do it for Him because I love Him.
