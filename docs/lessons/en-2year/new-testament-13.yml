Application: |
  Jesus was teaching the people about trusting God and loving others (Matt 5-7). That’s why He shared this parable about listening and doing His Word. He wants us to understand what it is like to really believe and live the truth. He explains what happens when we love God and follow His Word. I hear the Word of God at Sunday school. or maybe I read stories in a children’s Bible. When I hear and read, Jesus speaks to me. He not only wants me to hear interesting stories about Him but wants the things that I hear to change my heart. For example, when I hear that Jesus fed the people because He loved and cared for them, I remember that Jesus cares for me and I can ask Him to help me to care for others. If I have cookies, I can share them with someone and show them that I love them and want to care for them. I can tell them that Jesus loves them.
  In this story, Jesus said that the rain and wind hit hard and destroyed the house that was built upon the sand. Rain and wind can represent problems in life. Sometimes we are sick or we aren’t getting along with someone or we are scared. When we trust Jesus (which is doing what He tell us to do), He is our Rock and Foundation of life. Problems can never be stronger than Jesus! I believe that Jesus is with me, that He is my help, that everything works for good, and that He holds me in His hands. But people who don’t believe in Jesus are like the house built upon the sand. When everything is bad in life, they fall. __Jesus, help me not only to hear Your Word but to trust You and to do the things that I hear from the Bible (to trust You and love others). Thank you that You help me to hear and fulfill Your Word, to Love You and others with my life.__
