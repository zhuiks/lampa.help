Summary: |
  Jesus was visiting someone’s home and when they were at the table, one woman came and worshipped Jesus. She anointed His feet with expensive oil, washed them with her tears and out of thankfulness, wiped His feet dry with her hair. The host, Simon the Pharisee said that Jesus shouldn’t let this woman even touch Him because she had a bad reputation in the town.
  “And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say it.”  “There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?”  Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more. ”Jesus said that the woman loved Jesus very much because she understood how much God had forgiven her. Simon didn’t greet Jesus well into his home in comparison to this woman. “Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” (Luke 7:40-47)
  Jesus told her that her sins were forgiven. The people were amazed that Jesus had authority to forgive sins.
Character:
- Jesus is God
- Jesus forgives sins
- Jesus is worthy of worship
Application: |
  Sometimes I am like Simon, who invites Jesus to be near me but I don’t really respect or love Him much. Jesus, forgive me and give me a heart that understands how much you have forgiven me, so that I would be like the woman who worshipped you out of thankfulness. It’s good to think about the price that Jesus paid for me to forgive my sin. He shed His blood. He gave His life in order to reconcile me to Himself. __Thank you Jesus! I want to respect and love you with all of my life, with all that is important and valuable to me.__
