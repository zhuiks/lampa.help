Summary: |
  God told Samuel to anoint one of Jesse’s sons in Bethlehem to be king over Israel instead of Saul. Jesse had eight sons. Samuel thought that the oldest son would be king because he was tall and handsome, “but God told Samuel, don’t look at his appearance and at his height. I have rejected him. I don’t look in the way that people look: for man looks at the face but the Lord looks at the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7). Finally, they called David, the youngest son who was taking care of the sheep and God told Samuel to anoint him as king. The Holy Spirit filled David from that day and afterwards.
  Later, in a time of war with the Philistines, Jesse sent David to bring cheese and bread to his brothers who were in Saul’s army. No one was fighting because they were afraid of a big Philistine soldier named Goliath. He wanted to fight with one person from Israel to decide the battle and he said bad things about God.
  David heard him and trusted God. He decided to fight against him. Saul wanted to give David armor but it was too big for him. David told Goliath “you come against me with sword and spear and shield but I come against you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel who you spoke against (1 Sam. 17:45). He slung a stone at Goliath and he fell. God gave David and Israel victory over the Philistines.
