Summary: |
  Cornelius was a Gentile (a non-Jew, a person from the nations) that loved God but didn’t know about Jesus. God sent an angel to him and told him to call Peter. Peter was a Jew and didn’t socialize with Gentiles. God showed him a vision when he prayed and said, “What God has cleansed you must not call common (unclean)” (Acts 10:15). Peter didn’t understand, but when people from Cornelius came looking for him, God told Peter to go with them. Peter and some other Jewish believers went to Cornelius’s house where many people (Gentiles) were gathered. Cornelius wanted to bow to Peter, but he raised him up and said “I also am just a man.” (Acts 10:26)
  Cornelius wanted to hear a message from God. Peter understood that he should share with them about salvation in Jesus and that they weren’t “unclean Gentiles” but were people that Jesus wanted to save. When he shared about Jesus, the Holy Spirit came down on the Gentiles because they believed in Jesus. Peter and his friends were amazed that God gave the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit, just as He had given them. Then they were baptized in the name of Jesus.

Application: |
  Cornelius didn’t know much about God but worshipped Him and God heard his prayer and sent Peter to tell him about salvation in Jesus. The Jews thought that salvation in Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit was only for them but God showed them that salvation and the gift of the Holy Spirit is for every person who believes in Jesus. Cornelius invited many people to his house so they could hear from God. God saved many people that day when they heard about Jesus. Like Cornelius, I too want to seek God, love Him and invite people to hear about Jesus. I want to trust Jesus and worship Him. From this passage, I know that salvation in Jesus is for all who believe in Him!
  Peter didn’t understand God’s plan right away. He didn’t understand the vision he saw, but he was obedient to God when He sent him to Cornelius. Later, Peter understood that God wanted to save the Gentiles. Sometimes when I pray and read the Bible, I don’t understand everything but God shows me what to do. Jesus, help me to do what your Word says and trust You even when I don’t understand everything. Peter told the people about Jesus; God saved them and poured out His Holy Spirit on them. I believe that today God wants to save people and use me to tell them about Jesus. __Jesus, show me who to share with and how. Fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to tell people that You are the Only Saviour!__
  In the Bible, I see God’s plan to save everyone. He gave His law to the Jews and made a special covenant with them. He always wanted them to be a light to other nations so that the nations would see that God is the only true God. He sent His Son Jesus to the Jews. Jesus was a Jew and fulfilled God’s law which the Jews knew. It was always God’s plan that all believers in Jesus would be saved and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. God is merciful! __Thank you, Jesus, that you saved me and died for me on the cross. You rose again and You are alive and You are the Saviour of the world!__
