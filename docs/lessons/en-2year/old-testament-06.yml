Summary: |
  God commanded Abram to go out from his land and his father’s house to a land that He would show him. He promised to make a great nation out of Abram and bless all the nations of the earth through him.  Abram was obedient to God. He came to the land of Canaan. There God revealed Himself to Abram and promised to give that land to his descendants. Abram built an altar to the Lord. Later, when there was a famine (no food) in the land, Abram went to Egypt. He was afraid that the Egyptians would kill him and take his wife, Sarai. He asked her to say that she was his sister. People took Sarai to the house of Pharaoh anyway but God protected her and struck the household of Pharaoh because he had taken her. Pharaoh returned Sarai to Abram and asked him to leave.
