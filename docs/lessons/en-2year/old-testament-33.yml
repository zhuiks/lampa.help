Summary: |
  Saul was jealous of David and wanted to kill him, so David ran from him. Twice, Saul almost caught David, but God helped David to get away. Jonathan came to strengthen his friend David and to remind him that he would be king (1 Sam. 21-23).
  Again, Saul was looking for David in the mountains. He went into a cave where David was hiding. David could have killed him but instead decided to cut off a corner of Saul’s clothes. When Saul was standing far away, David came out of the cave and showed Saul the cloth. Saul understood that David didn’t want to kill him and went away (1 Sam. 24)
  David and his people guarded Nabal’s sheep. When Nabal was having a party, they wanted to celebrate with him but Nabal was very rude and David was offended. He wanted to kill Nabal. But Nabal’s wise wife, Abigail, asked David to be merciful. He listened to her. God took Nabal’s life through sickness. Later, David married Abigail (1 Sam. 25)
  Saul again was looking for David to try to kill him. At night, David went into Saul’s tent and again had a chance to kill him but for the second time, he spared his life. He took a water jug that was near Saul’s head. Then he left and from far away woke everyone up and showed them the jug, so that Saul would know that David didn’t want to kill Saul (1 Sam. 26).

Application: |
  I can ask help from God to know what to do when things are hard. Just like Abigail, I can share God’s wisdom with people so they would know God’s will (what God wants). Just like David, I can love my enemy and not look for how to get back at them. Jesus gives me strength to not pay back my enemies, but to be kind to them. Jesus died for me when I was a sinner and an enemy of God! He was kind to me before I even loved Him. Jesus will come again and will judge and punish all those who don’t believe in Him. It’s not my job to punish people for the wrong that they do. This is God’s job. __Jesus, help me to love my enemies. Change the heart of my enemies, that they would see your kindness and turn to you for forgiveness.__
