Summary: |
  The people of Israel weren’t following God and their enemies started to take them over. An angel of the Lord  appeared to a woman and told her that she would have a special child. This child would live according to special rules to show that he would participate in God’s special plan. This child was Samson. He grew up to be very strong because God gave him special strength to fight against the enemies. His strength was from God and God told him to follow special rules and to not cut his hair. A woman named Delilah talked Samson into telling her the secret that if his hair was cut, he would lose his strength. She betrayed him to the Philistines (the enemies) for money. When he slept, they cut his hair and he lost his strength.
  Samson had killed many enemies but now he was their slave in their prison. His enemies had also blinded him. Later, his hair started to grow and he asked God to give him strength to destroy the temple he was in, where his enemies were worshipping their false god. God answered his prayer.
Character:

Application: |
  Samson did not always live the way that God wanted and fell into trouble. When I love Jesus, He can help me to love the truth and the right way. I want to follow God because He is the only one worthy of glory and He is worthy to be followed. God helps me in difficulties. God is my strength. Jesus gives me strength to live in the way that He asks. The Holy Spirit helps me.
