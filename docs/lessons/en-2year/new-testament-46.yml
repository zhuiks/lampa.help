Title: Fruit of the Spirit
Book: 'Galatians: Freedom in Christ'
Scripture: Gal 5:22-23 (Teacher should read all of Galatians, plus Acts 15)
Truth: Jesus saves everyone by grace
Verse: Gal 5:22-23 “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there
  is no law.” or Eph. 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that
  not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”
Summary: |
  Paul and Barnabas were in an area called Galatia (Acts 14). They heard that some of the believing Jews told the believing Gentiles that they should keep the whole law if they wanted to be real believers in Jesus (Gal 1:6). Paul wrote a letter to the believers in Galatia so they would remember that all people are saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in His righteousness and not by keeping the law (which is impossible). Only Jesus (who is God and man) fulfilled the whole law (Rom. 8:3-4). Paul wrote, “knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified” (Gal 2:16). Believers understand that Jesus fulfilled the whole law and gives them new life. “For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. “ (Gal. 2:19-20).
  In Gal. 5, Paul writes that believers should walk in the Spirit (that is, follow Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit). “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.” (Gal. 5:22-23) When a person belongs to Jesus (through faith in Him), he won’t live according to his selfish desires but will live by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit (Gal. 5:24). In Gal. 6, he writes that believers don’t boast in their deeds or in how they fulfill the law which doesn’t save them. They boast in Christ Jesus and in what He accomplished on the cross (Gal. 6:14).
  In Jerusalem, there was a church council where they discussed the question of salvation for the Gentiles (Acts 15). They all agreed that Jesus saves everyone by grace and that the law doesn’t save. That’s why it wasn’t right to teach people to fulfill the law for salvation. They wrote the Gentile believers a letter where they explained this. Then Paul and Silas returned to Galatia to see the believers and tell them that truly, they are all saved through faith in Jesus Christ and not through works of the law. (Acts 16:1-6).

Application: |
  Jesus saves me and everyone who believes in Him by grace. Trying to fulfill the law doesn’t save me. I am wrong if I think that God will accept me if I do good works. God accepts those who put their faith in the perfect life, sacrifice and victory of Jesus. I trust in the righteousness of Jesus and not my “righteousness”. When I believe in Him, by grace, He forgives my sin and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit, who lives in me and helps me to live pleasing to God. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. When I love Jesus (and He helps me to love Him), then just like an apple tree that grows apples, so my life and my heart will be filled with love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. I can ask Jesus to grow the fruit of the Holy Spirit in my life and that I would love Him and others more and more.

Which examples from the life of Jesus can I remember that are examples of:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? __Jesus, please grow the fruit of the Spirit in my life.__
