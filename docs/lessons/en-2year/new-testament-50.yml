Summary: |
  in Rev. 21 and 22, Jesus gave John a vision of what will happen in the future. He wrote, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful” (Rev. 21:1-5).
  Jesus said that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. All unbelievers will be in hell, which is a lake of fire. John saw the New Jerusalem, where believers live with Jesus forever. The city is very beautiful. Believers “shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.” (Rev. 22:4-5) Jesus says several times that He is coming soon! Believers answer that they want Jesus to come and also want people to come to Jesus for new life that He gives as a gift. (Rev. 22:17)

Application: |+
  God has a great plan of salvation. He wants people to be with Him. Without Jesus, everyone is separated from Him because of sin. But all can receive forgiveness through faith in Jesus. I and everyone that trusts Jesus can be with God forever. This is good news! Do I believe in Jesus? Do I understand the salvation He offers? If I trust Him, then right now Jesus lives in my heart and His Holy Spirit is in me. But one day, Jesus will come and take me to be with Him.
  He will make a new heaven and new earth. There, I will live with Jesus forever! In that place, there will be no sin, pain or suffering. There in heaven, also called the New Jerusalem, I will see Jesus face to face! I want everyone to be there with Jesus. That’s why I want to tell people about Him. Now, people can be saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in Him. But there will be a time when it will be too late and Jesus will judge those who didn’t believe in Him and punish them in hell.
  Jesus gives rewards to those to believe in Him.__ Jesus, I don’t want people to go to hell. I want them to be with You in heaven. Save people, Jesus, and help me to tell people about salvation in You and about the hope of heaven, where You will reign. Help me to warn people about hell so they will quickly turn to the Saviour for mercy and forgiveness. Jesus, I am waiting for You! You are coming soon! I will be very glad to see You! You are my King and Saviour! I love you. Thank you for Your Great Love!__
