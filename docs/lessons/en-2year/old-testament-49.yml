Summary: |
  Neh.1: Nehemiah lived in Susa and heard that his city, Jerusalem, was in ruins and that the walls were broken down. He cried before the Lord and prayed to Him. He confessed his sins and the sins of his people. He was the cupbearer to the king.
  Neh. 2: When Nehemiah was serving the king, the king noticed that Nehemiah’s face was sad. He wanted to know the reason and Nehemiah explained that his city was destroyed and that he wanted to rebuild the walls there. The king allowed him to go to Jerusalem and gave him all the necessary materials for building. Nehemiah came to Jerusalem and at night he looked at the walls. The enemies heard the plan to rebuild and laughed at them but Nehemiah answered the enemies that God would help their people.
  Neh. 4: The people built the walls halfway but the enemies threatened them. The people continued to build with a sword in one hand and their tools in the other. They said “our God will fight for us.”
  Neh. 6: The people finished building the walls and celebrated!

Application: |
  Nehemiah asked God to forgive him and his people. I can ask Jesus for forgiveness and know that He hears my prayers and forgives me. He hears my prayers. God used Nehemiah to lead people in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.  I can ask for inspiration from God and He will show me His plan so I can participate in His work for His kingdom. When I do what God wants and people (enemies) are against me, I won’t be afraid because God is my help. Perhaps something in my heart or my life seems broken down like the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus can restore and heal the brokenness in my life and in my heart. Jesus, I trust you to restore and heal me. I trust You to give me strength to continue to do what You have shown me to do. Remind me that you fight for me! You died on the cross to fight against sin and death and the devil and you won! You are my help and I praise You!
