Summary: |
  “Then Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him,“Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, “He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.”Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.”And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:1-10)

Application: |
  Zacchaeus was a dishonest person who offended many people. He really wanted to see Jesus. He probably heard that Jesus did many miracles and that people called Him Saviour. Jesus knew Zaccheaus’ name and knew that he was watching Him from the tree. He knew that he had stolen money from people. Jesus wanted to be with Zacchaeus and change his life. Jesus sought to spend time with a person that everyone in the town hated. Jesus loved him and wanted to save him. Zaccheaus really changed after spending time (fellowshipping) with Jesus. After he experienced Jesus’ love he became honest and generous instead of selfish.
  Zacchaeus was looking for Jesus when he climbed the tree, but Jesus was looking for him! Jesus knew his heart and He knows my heart. He knows my sins and how I can be greedy or selfish. He knows my name. He wants to spend time with me. At any time or in any place, I can talk with (fellowship) with Him and not only when I pray, read the Bible or sing worship songs! When I fellowship with Jesus, He changes me! I experience His love and care and He gives me love for others. He fills me with the Holy Spirit and gives me a new heart that loves God and others.
  Maybe other people see that I fellowship with Jesus and they don’t like it. God’s opinion is most important and not the opinion of people. It’s important to know that Jesus loves me and to also love Him. I want to tell people about Jesus so that they would believe in Him and that He would change their lives. Only Jesus can change a person’s heart. I want to pray for _______________, that like Zacchaeus, they would know Jesus and that God would change him/her just like He changed Zaccheaus. I want to be loving and generous like Jesus and like Zacchaeus. __Jesus, help me to love like You love. Thank you for seeking me, finding me and saving me. Thank you that you change my heart and my life!__
