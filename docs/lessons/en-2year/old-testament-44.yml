Summary: |2-

  2 Kings 17: the king of Assyria took over the land of Israel and make the people move to a far away land. God allowed this because they didn’t listen to Him and worshipped idols. God sent them prophets but they didn’t listen to them. They didn’t want to follow God’s Word.
  2 Kings 25: The Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem and destroyed the temple and the beautiful houses. He led the people away to captivity in Babylon.
  Jeremiah 25:11-12: God told the people that they would be in captivity for 70 years and then God would punish Babylon.
  Isaiah 44: God said that it’s foolish to worship idols that are made by people. He also promised to return the people to their land.
  Daniel 1: Nebuchadnezzar took many people away from Judah when he conquered it. Daniel and his friends were some of those people. King Nebuchadnezzar had a special plan for Daniel and his friends. He wanted them to serve in his kingdom and wanted them to study the ways for Babylon for three years. He also gave them food from his table. But Daniel and his friends couldn’t eat the king’s food because it wasn’t clean according to God’s law. God gave them favor with the person in charge of them when Daniel asked to only eat vegetables and drink water. He decided to test them for 10 days and the Babylonians saw that Daniel and his friends looked better than those who were eating the king’s food. Daniel and his friends continued to study and God gave them wisdom and knowledge. At the end of the three years, the king tested them and saw that Daniel and his friends were the best.
  King Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream. He wanted to know what it meant. He wanted his wise men to tell him his dream and if they couldn’t, he would kill all of the wise men. Daniel and his friends prayed to God for help. God told Daniel the the king’s dream and it’s meaning. In the dream there was a big statue made of different metals. In the end, a big rock destroyed the statue and became big mountain that filled the earth. Daniel explained that the different metals were different kingdoms. The big Rock was God’s eternal kingdom that would destroy all the other ones and rule forever. Nebuchadnezzar said that Daniel’s God was the best and rewarded Daniel and his friends with good jobs serving him.

Application: |
  The people in Israel and Judah lived their own way. They worshipped idols and did evil things.  God sent many prophets to warn the people and ask them to return to loving Him alone. He punished them by sending them into exile. This showed them that life without God is painful. But God promised to bring His people back to their land. He took care of His people that loved and trusted Him.
  Daniel and his friends trusted God and did what was pleasing to Him. They loved God and that’s why they didn’t want to eat the king’s food.  Jesus, help me to follow You even when “important” people are telling me to do something else. People saw that following God was good. Jesus is glorified (seen as great) in my life when I love and follow Him.
  Daniel knew that God knows everything and that He rules over everything and controls everything. He knew that God could tell him the king’s dream. The king then understood that God is the greatest. When I follow Jesus and look to Him for help, others see that He is great. Jesus is the big rock in the king’s dream that will get rid of all the other kingdoms and rule forever. He is big and strong and He rules over everything and everyone__. Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because Your kingdom is forever.__
