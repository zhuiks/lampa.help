Summary: |
  Before he died, David made his son Solomon king. 1 Kings. 3: God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said “ask, what should I give you” (1 Kings 3:5). He asked God to give him wisdom because he was young and didn’t know how to rule the people. God was pleased with his request and gave Solomon more wisdom than other people. He also promised to give him riches. Once, two women came to Solomon for judgement of their argument about to whom a baby belonged. One of the women lied. Solomon gave the order to cut the child in half but the real mother didn’t want her child to die and was ready to give him to the other woman whereas the other woman wanted him to die. Then Solomon knew who the real mother was and gave the baby to her. The people all saw the wisdom that God gave Solomon.
  1 Kings 6: Solomon built a temple (a place for worshipping God) in Jerusalem. It was big and beautiful. Many people over many years helped to build the temple.
  1 Kings 8: The people gathered to worship God when the temple was built. They brought the ark of the covenant into the temple. The priests sacrificed to God and the glory of the Lord in a cloud filled the temple. Solomon prayed to God and thanked Him for fulfilling His Word to the people. He commanded the people to always follow after God and asked God to answer the prayers prayed toward the temple. The people celebrated for 7 days.
  1 Kings 10: The Queen of Sheba came to Solomon and asked him many questions. Solomon answered her questions and she was amazed at his wisdom. He showed her his kingdom and riches. She was amazed. She gave Solomon a lot of gold and spices and jewels. Solomon gave her all that she wanted and she returned home. Solomon’s kingdom was very beautiful and rich.
  1 Kings 11: Solomon took many foreign wives and started to worship false gods.

Application: |
  Just like Solomon, I can ask for wisdom from God and know that He will give it to me. Jesus helps me live God’s way and to not compromise. I don’t always understand what is right, but God does and His Word tells me what is right. God knows what is in my heart and in the hearts of others.
  I  want to praise God with my life. I want to live my life for Jesus and be God’s temple (the place where His glory is, where His Holy Spirit is, where He is worshipped). I pray to God and know that he hears me. I come to Jesus for wisdom (just like the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon) and know that God has all the answers. He is a generous King who loves me. I can be generous and share with other people.  Solomon didn’t follow God all of his days. This is sad.__ Jesus, please help me to follow you all of my days! Please fill me with your Holy Spirit to help me to love you and follow you.__
