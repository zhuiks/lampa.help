Application: |
  Jesus died and rose again in order to redeem me. He looks at His church (a group of believers) as a treasure. He gave His life to make me His own, so that I would belong to Him. Do I believe that Jesus paid a high price to make me His own? I am very thankful to Jesus that He redeemed me. It was Jesus’ joy to do this, as it says in Hebrews 12:2 “looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.” See also Luke 19:10 “for the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost.” When I understand how I am a sinner, how I was lost and how Jesus is Holy, I am amazed that He sought me out to save me and make me His special treasure. This makes me treasure Him! __Jesus, you are most valuable to me, like a treasure! Teach me more about Yourself, and grow my love for you, so that I would treasure you more!__
