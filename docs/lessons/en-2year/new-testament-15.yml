Summary: |
  Luke 7:2-10 “And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear to him, was sick and ready to die.  So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant.  And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving,  “for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.” Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.  Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”  When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, “I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!”And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.”

Application: |
  The centurion went to Jesus because he knew that Jesus could help. I also can ask Jesus for help. The centurion knew that Jesus had authority and when He said something, it would happen. He knew that Jesus didn’t need to physically be present for his servant to be healed. I don’t see Jesus with my eyes right now but I believe that He hears my prayers, He sees my needs and He is always with me. Jesus was amazed when He heard of the centurion’s faith. Jesus loves it when I trust Him and talk with Him. Our faith is precious (valuable) to Him, more than gold (1 Pet. 1:7).
  The centurion respected Jesus and knew that he wasn’t worthy for Jesus to come to his house. I understand that I also am not worthy of Jesus’ love, grace and forgiveness. But when I believe in Him, He says that I can come to Him at any time and at any hour with any need. The centurion was Roman and probably didn’t study God’s Word in his childhood like the Jews did. But for Jesus, our nationality isn’t important. He wants everyone to come to Him for salvation, forgiveness and help. He is pleased when we come to Him. __Jesus, I  believe that You are strong, that You are God and that You love me and help me. I love You, Jesus, and thank You for Your love and care towards me.__
