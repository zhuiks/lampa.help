Title: The Tower of Babel
Book: 'Genesis: The origination of the nations (1-11)'
Scripture: Gen. 11
Truth: God is the greatest
Verse: Psalm 34:3 “Oh, magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.”
Summary: |
  All the people of the earth spoke the same language and lived in one place all together. They decided to build a tower all the way up to heaven, so that they could be famous. God came down from heaven and looked at the tower. He didn’t like it that people wanted glory (greatness) for themselves. He decided to mix up their languages so that people wouldn’t understand one another. Then people couldn’t work on the tower together. God scattered them all over the earth.
Character:
- God has control over everything
- God alone is worthy of glory
- God is Creator
- He created all the languages
Application: |+
  It’s good to look for ways to glorify God (help people to see that He is great), and not to glorify myself (make everyone think that I’m great). Jesus gives believers His Holy Spirit who helps us to live for God’s glory. I know that God sees everything and controls everything. God created my language and other languages that I have heard. God loves it when people work together to give Him glory.

Songs:
- The Wise Man Built His House upon the Rock
- Jesus Loves Me (try singing the chorus in a different language)
