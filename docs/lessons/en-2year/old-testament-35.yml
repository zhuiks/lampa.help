  Just as David kept his word and helped Jonathan’s son, I can know that God keeps His Word to save me and help me. Jesus helps me to keep my word when I promise to do something. David showed mercy to Mephibosheth. God showed me mercy. He sent Jesus to die for me and forgives my sin when I trust in Him. Every day and every minute, He shows me mercy, love and care. __Jesus, I  praise and thank You. Help me show mercy to others so that they would know Your love. __
