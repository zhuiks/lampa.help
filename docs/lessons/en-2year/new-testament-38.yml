Summary: |
  The believers waiting in Jerusalem, just like Jesus said. “When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?” (Acts 2:1-7).
  People from all different nations heard the believers speaking about the mighty works of God in their own languages. They gathered together and Peter shared with the people about salvation in Jesus. Many people (3,000!) believed in Jesus that day and they gathered to study the Word, eat together and pray (Acts 2:42). God did miracles through the apostles and ” … continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved” (Acts 2:46-47).

Application: |
  Jesus gave believers His Holy Spirit just as He promised. The Holy Spirit gave the believers power to witness about Jesus. This passage talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I see that Jesus wants to pour out the Holy Spirit on each believer. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus and not to people. The Holy Spirit helps people to understand that Jesus is Saviour, God and King.
  __Jesus, fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to share with people about You. Thank you that You are my help. Just as you gave Peter words to share with people, please give me words when I need them. Help me to rely upon You.__
  Jesus builds the Church. The Church is a group of people who love Jesus and follow Him. I am a part of the Church when I believe in Jesus and fellowship with other believers. People that are part of the Church not only read the Bible and pray but they also love Jesus and one another by sharing their lives with one another. Believers often gather together with one another. Others see our lives and how we love Jesus and one another. Often, they want to know Jesus too after they see this love. __God, bless our church and save even more people through us. __
