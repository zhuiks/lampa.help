Summary: |
  There was famine in Israel and Naomi and her family moved to the land of Moab, where people did not worship God. Her sons married girls there who were not Israelites.  Naomi’s husband and sons died. Naomi returned to the land of Israel and one of her daughter- in-laws’, Ruth, believed in God and wanted to stay with Naomi, to help her.
  Ruth went to work in a field gathering grain. She was a hard worker. The owner of the field, Boaz, met her and gave her food. He said that she should work at his field where it was safe. Naomi knew the law about redemption in Israel. According to this law, a close relative could marry Ruth and then take care of her and Naomi. Boaz was a close relative. Naomi told Ruth to go remind Boaz that he was a close relative. Boaz loved God and wanted to help but he waited to see if the other close relative wanted to do fulfill the redemption law and buy Naomi’s land and marry Ruth. But that relative didn’t want to marry Ruth. Then Boaz was happy to marry Ruth and God gave them a child. Naomi thanked God. Thier son became the grandfather of David.
Character:
- God is wise
- God is faithful
- He always is with us
- God is our help
- Jesus is Redeemer
- He paid for our sin, protects us and cares for us
- God has a good plan
- Jesus is the Saviour of all peoples
Application: |
  Boaz is a picture (someone who shows us something) of Jesus. Boaz paid a price to redeem Naomi’s land and to marry Ruth. Jesus paid a price when He died for me on the cross to redeem me from my sin and make me His own. He is my saviour who loves me and cares about me. I can come to Jesus for help. I am glad that He never leaves me or forsakes me.
  Ruth is a picture of the nations (non Israelites) who are a part of the Church. Israel is God’s special people and He showed His plan of salvation through them. He wants all people on earth to know about Him through the Israelites. Ruth, a Gentile (from the nations) came to know God and she was redeemed. Jesus is the Redeemer of people from all nations who trust Him for salvation. Through faith, Ruth became a part of God’s plan. Through faith in Jesus, I too am a part of God’s plan. __Jesus, use my life so that many people will come to know you, that you are Redeemer.__
  God fulfilled His plan to give Israel the promised Redeemer through the family of Ruth and Boaz. Their great grandson David (about whom we will learn soon) became king and God promised him that the Messiah would come through David’s family. After many years, Jesus fulfilled this promise and came from the family of David. He is our King and Redeemer.
