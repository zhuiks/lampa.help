Summary: |
  “Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep.  Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”  But He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.  So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?” (Matt. 8:23-27)

Application: |
  When I am scared, I can call to Jesus and He will help me. Jesus is always with me and wants to help. He created everything and that’s why He has authority over everything. Everything submits to Jesus. Jesus, when He was on the earth slept (because He is 100% God and 100% human) but He was always ready to help at any moment. Now, Jesus is in heaven and never sleeps. He is even so close to those who believe in Him that you can say that He lives right in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). Do I believe in Jesus? When I am afraid, do I understand that Jesus is my help and that nothing and no one is higher than Him. If He says something, then it will be. When there our waves of worry in my heart, He can bring peace and calm. He is kind and loving towards me.
