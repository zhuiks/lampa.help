  Jesus wants me to come to Him. He loves me and He blesses me. He receives me when I come to Him. I can talk with Jesus and know that He hears me even when I don’t see Him. I know that He is kind. I know that He showed His love when He died on the cross for my sin. He showed that He is God when He rose from the dead. He is alive and He wants me to be near to Him right now and forever. He is near me. I can be close to Him through faith in Him. The Bible says that Jesus lives in my heart when I believe in Him (see Eph. 3:14-19 esp v. 17).
  see also 2 Cor. 6:16 “…For you[a] are the temple of the living God.”
  Eph 2:22 “in whom you also are being built together for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit”
  Col 1:27 “…Christ in you, the hope of glory”
  Jesus has a kingdom. I can be in His kingdom when I trust Him. I love Jesus and He loves me. To be in His kingdom means that I understand that He is King. He is the most important and I want to do what is pleasing to Him. How can I know what He likes? The Bible tells me! His Word teaches me about Him and His heart.__ Jesus, teach me to love You and live close to You.__
