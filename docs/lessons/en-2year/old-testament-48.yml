Summary: |2

  Ezra 1-6 can be shared in brief just to remind the children of what happened before Ezra arrived.
  Ezra 1: God fulfilled His Word that he spoke through Isaiah that a king named Cyrus would command the Israelites in captivity to return to their land and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. (see also 2 Chron. 36:22-23, Isaiah 44:28)
  Ezra 2:Many people returned to Israel
  Ezra 3: People build an altar in Jerusalem and celebrated (they remembered how God had taken care of them when they came out of slavery in Egypt and into the promised land). Then they rebuilt the foundation of the temple in Jerusalem so that they could worship God there again. They praised God with songs.
  Ezra 4-6: the enemies of God wrote a letter to the new king so that the Israelites would stop rebuilding and the work stopped. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah spoke God’s Word to the people that they should continue rebuilding the temple. “Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’Says the Lord of hosts.” (Zechariah 4:6) The people wrote a letter to the new king, Darius and asked for his permission. God gave a command through Darius and he told them that they could continue the work. The people were obedient to God’s word that the prophets spoke and started to rebuild the temple.

  Ezra 7-8: Ezra “came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.” (Ezra 7:9-10). The king gave Ezra a special letter promising him help for teaching people to worship God. Many people decided to go back to Jerusalem with Ezra. They brought a lot of silver and gold articles for worship in the temple. They prayed and fasted to God for a safe journey and God answered their prayer (Ezra 8:21-23, 31).

  Ezra 9-10:  Ezra heard that some people had married women who didn’t love God but who worshipped idols. He tore his clothes, pulled some hair from his beard, sat down in shock and didn’t eat until evening time. He prayed to God, admitting that the people were guilty. He reminded the people that God had sent them into exile and that in His mercy had brought them back to the land. Many people gathered around Ezra and started crying and confessing their sin (Ezra 10:1-2). They decided to promise to follow God and not to have the wives that didn’t love God.  They gathered together on a very rainy day and decided to follow God.

Application: |
  God promised to bring the people back to the land. I know that when God promises something, He will fulfill His Word. The Bible is God’s Word and it is true. Jesus helps me to fulfill God’s Word just as God helped the people to rebuild the temple when He commanded them to do so. Sometimes, people stand in the way of God’s work but nothing can stop God.
  Ezra was sad when he heard that people were not following God’s Word (when they married women who didn’t love God). The people were convicted of sin (realized that they were guilty), they confessed it (admitted their sin to God), they repented and obeyed God’s Word (followed God).
  *Idea for teaching: use gestures to teach the key words: convicted, confession, repentance and obedience. Convicted (strike your heart with your finger, like an arrow is piercing it), Confession (touch your mouth and then bring your hand away from your mouth to show a speaking action), Repentance (turn around from facing one way), Obedience (take a step in the new direction).
  Has God’s Word ever convicted me of sin? Jesus calls me to confess, repent and obey. He is my help and He is ready to forgive me and give my strength by His Holy Spirit to follow Him!
  __ Thank you God for Your love and mercy that You show me in Jesus Christ. I want to follow You.__
