Summary: |
  King Nebuchadnezzar made a huge idol and gathered the leaders from his kingdom so that they would worship it when the music played. The friends of Daniel: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were there. They loved God and decided not to worship the idol. Other people complained about them to the king. The king gave them another chance to bow to the idol and if not, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. But they said that their God could save them and even if He did allow them to die, they wouldn’t worship the idol. The king got angry and heated the furnace seven times hotter. It was so hot that those who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the furnace died from the heat. Then the king saw that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn’t die but that God saved them and that even One who looked like the Son of God was with them in the fire. The king told them to come out and saw that even their hair and clothing was not burned by the fire. Then the king praised God and wanted all his people to respect God (Dan. 3:28-29).
Character:
- God alone is worthy of worship
- God hears everything
- God sees everything
- God is jealous
- He is Saviour
- He is with us
- He is worthy to be praised
- He is God of everyone in the whole world
Application: |
  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in a very difficult situation. In the face of death, they chose to worship God alone. When I am in difficult circumstances, Jesus helps me  not compromise or do what is displeasing to God. The One like the Son of God was with them in the furnace. Jesus, the Son of God and Son of Man, is with me when unbelievers threaten me. Often, when I follow Jesus, unbelievers will understand later that God is great and worthy of praise.
