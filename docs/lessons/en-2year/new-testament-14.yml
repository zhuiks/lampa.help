Summary: |
  Jesus saw the paralyzed man by the pool where people were laying around and waiting, wanting to be healed. He asked him “Do you want to be made well?” The man answered that he couldn’t get into the pool for healing. Jesus told the man “Stand, take up your bed and walk.” The man was made well, stood, took his bed and walked! The spiritual leaders saw him and scolded him because he was walking around with his bed on the sabbath, but the healed man said that he was just doing what the One who had healed him told him to do. He didn’t know that Jesus had healed him. Jesus later found him and told him not to sin. The man told the spiritual leaders that Jesus had healed him. They got angry that Jesus healed on the sabbath. “But Jesus answered them: My Father has been working until now and I have been working.” (Jn. 5:17). Then they got even angrier because Jesus was calling God His Father and by this was saying that He is equal to God.

Application: |
  Jesus wanted to heal the helpless man. He is God and He came to save me and everyone because we are all helpless without Him. He knew where that man went after he was healed and found him. He knows what is in people’s hearts and that’s why He warned the man not to sin. The man was carrying his bed around and it seems like he didn’t respect the spiritual leaders. Jesus always sees me and knows everything that is in my heart. He warns me through my conscience, through the Word and also through other people when I start to sin. He helps me to do what is right when I ask Him to help.
  Like the Pharisees in the story, there are people who don’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus Himself said that He is God and did things that only God can do. He never sinned. He rose from the dead and He does miracles which give glory to God. Does Jesus have the first place in my life? He should be most important because He is God. He loves me very much and He is Almighty. He is worthy of my respect and love.  Jesus said in Jn. 5:24 “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life.”
