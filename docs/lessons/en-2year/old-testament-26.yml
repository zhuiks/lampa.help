Summary: |
  The 40 years of punishment was finished. Moses had died. God told the people to go into the promised land. A new group of spies went into the land and hid in the house of Rahab in the city of Jericho. Rahab heard and believed that God was mighty. The spies promised to save her and her family if she would hang a red cord in her window, so they could remember which house was hers.
  The Israelites were ready to cross over into the promised land and God told them to cross the Jordan river. God promised to stop the water when they stepped into the river so that they could safely cross over to the other side. And God did it!
  Jericho was a large city with big thick walls. God told the people to silently march once around the city of Jericho for 6 days and on the 7th day to march around the city 7 times and then to blow their trumpets. Then the walls around the city of Jericho came falling down!  God gave the city to the Israelites and the people knew that God is great and mighty. Rahab and her family were saved out of the city because she hung the red cord in her window.
Character:
- God is powerful! God keeps His promises
- God saves those who believe in Him
- God can do the impossible
- God is the strongest! Nothing and no one is stronger than God
Application: |
  God told the people to do something that seemed impossible. Jericho was a large city with big thick walls but God was stronger than the walls! Even when something seems impossible, I know that with God nothing is impossible. I believe that God is powerful.  Rahab believed in God and put the red cord in her window. The red cord reminds me of the blood over the windows at Passover and of Jesus’ blood. Just like God saved Rahab, He saves me when I believe that Jesus’ paid for my sin with His blood.
