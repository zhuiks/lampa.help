Summary: |
  Peter and John found the place to celebrate Passover, just like Jesus told them. Jesus ate with His friends. He loved them and washed their feet. He said “For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.“ (Jn.13:15-16) Then Jesus explained to the disciples that soon He would die for them. He gave them to drink from the cup and said that the wine was like His blood that He would shed for them. He gave them bread and said that it was like His body that He would give to be broken for them. He told them to drink and eat and “do this in remembrance of Me “ (Luke 22:19). Jesus said that He knew which one of the disciples would betray Him (Jn. 13:21). Judas Iscariot left and betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill Him. Jesus told Peter that he would deny Jesus three times. Peter didn’t believe it.
  That night, Jesus and His disciples prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. But the disciples fell asleep. Jesus prayed to the Father and said  “…Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done “ (Matt. 26:39). Then Judas Iscariot came with soldiers and betrayed Jesus with a kiss. Peter wanted to fight, but Jesus forbid him and even healed the person that Peter hurt. Jesus went with them.

Application: |
  Jesus loved His friends and washed their feet. He said that He gave them an example. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit to help me follow His example to love and serve others. Jesus knew that Judas Iscariot would betray Him but He still loved him and washed his feet too. __Jesus, help me also to love those who don’t love me.__
  Jesus knew that He would die on the cross. That’s why He prayed to God the Father. He asked His friends to pray with Him. He gave us an example. When things are hard for me or I’m scared, I can pray to the Heaven Father just like Jesus. I also can ask my friends to pray for me and with me. Maybe my friends can’t understand me or give me the support that I need (Jesus’ friends fell asleep!), but Jesus hears my prayers and He is with me. He is my help. He understands me because He also experienced hard times.
  Jesus chose to fulfill the will of God the Father and fulfill Scripture by dying for my sins. He didn’t hide in the garden; He didn’t run from the soldiers. Even though He could have called angels to fight for Him (Matt. 26:53), He bravely went with the soldiers because He knew that it was God’s plan from eternity and He loved me. I am very thankful to Jesus for His Great Love. Jesus fulfilled the will of the Father and not His own. Then Jesus’ will and the Father’s were the same. Jesus helps me to fulfill His will and not my own. He helps me so that what I want is the same as what God wants. Often, my will is selfish (something that makes only me glad), but God’s will is what makes Jesus glad.__ Jesus, help me to fulfill Your will and serve and love like You. __
