Title: God prepares the way for the Saviour

Book: The Manifestation of Christ.

Scripture: Luke 1

Truth: God has a plan for salvation

Verse: "Luke 1:37 ”For with God nothing will be impossible.”"

Summary: |-
  God sent an angel to Zacharias the priest while he was serving Him to say that although he and his wife were childless and already old, He would give them a son, John. John would prepare the way for people to receive Jesus. Zechariah didn’t believe right away and the angel told him that he wouldn’t be able to speak until God’s Word to him was fulfilled (Luke 1:20). God said that John would be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb (Luke 1:15).

  An angel told Mary that God chose her to give birth to the Son of God, Jesus. She believed.

  Mary went to visit Elizabeth (Zacharias’ wife) and praised the Lord.

  Elizabeth had her son and when Zacharias wrote that his name is John, he was able to speak again. He prophesied about John, that he would prepare the way and help the people to understand God’s salvation and forgiveness of sins (Luke 1:77).

Character: 
  - God is Saviour
  - God fulfills His plan and His Word
  - Jesus is the Son of God
  - Jesus is sinless
  - He is Holy
  - He does the impossible


Application: |-
  It seemed impossible that Zacharias and Elizabeth would have a son, it seemed impossible that Mary could have a baby but God promised long ago to send us a Saviour and He fulfilled His Word. He also promised that He would send a messenger to prepare the way for Jesus. This messenger is John the Baptist. The prophets Isaiah and Malachi spoke about John (see Is. 40:3, Mal. 3:1). I can trust God and His Word. Jesus came into Mary’s womb by the Holy Spirit and that’s why I know that Jesus is sinless. He is God and man. For God nothing is impossible. Does something seem impossible in my life? I am confident that for Jesus it isn’t hard. It is good to follow the example of Mary and believe God’s Word. Jesus, I praise you and and thank you that you saved me and forgave my sin. Thank you for doing the impossible! You are amazing!
