Summary: |
  Ch. 5: God provided everything for building the temple.
  Ch. 6: Solomon built the temple (the place of worship) for God in Jerusalem. It was big and beautiful. Many people over many years built the temple. God spoke to Solomon and warned him to follow Him (v. 11-13).
  Ch. 7: Solomon built his house. Hiram made everything that was needed for ministry in the temple.
  Ch. 8: When the temple was finished being built, all the people gathered to worship God. They brought the ark of the covenant into the temple. Inside the ark were the tablets with the 10 commandments. The priests offered sacrifices to God and the Lord’s glory filled the temple. Solomon prayed to God and thanked Him that He fulfilled His Word to the people. He commanded the people to always follow God and asked God to answer their prayers in the temple. The people celebrated for 7 days.
  Ch. 9: God again spoke to Solomon and said that He heard his prayer. He warned Solomon to follow Him and said that the temple would be destroyed if the people walked away from God (v. 1-9). In 2 Chron. 7:14, He promised that if “ My people who are called by My name humble themselves, pray and seek My face, and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.”

Application: |
  Today I don’t need to go to a temple to worship God. Believers in Jesus are themselves considered a temple of God (see 1 Cor. 3:16-17). Jesus gives believers His Holy Spirit, who lives in my heart (when I believe in Jesus). I can praise and worship God with my life. I can give (commit) my life to Jesus and become God’s “temple” (a place where His glory and His presence dwell, where He is worshiped). I can pray to God and know that He hears me. God warned Solomon and wanted him to love Him and follow Him. God also speaks to me through the Bible and wants me to love Him and follow Him. Jesus, help me to follow You joyfully all of my days!__None__
