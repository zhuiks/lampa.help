Summary: |+
  Abram and Sarai didn’t wait for the son that God had promised them. Sarai told Abram to take Hagar, her servant, as a second wife and to have a son through her. Hagar was pregnant with Ishmael and started to look down on Sarai. They didn’t get along and Hagar ran away. God spoke to her and said that her son would have a wild character. God promised to give her son, Ishmael, many descendants. She called God, “the God who sees”. Hagar returned to Sara.  She gave birth to Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old.
  Chapt. 17: Later, after 13 years, God gave Abram and Sarai new names (Abraham and Sarah). He promised that they would have many descendants. He promised that Ishmael would also have many descendants and be a great people too. God promised to give Abraham the land of Canaan and told him to circumcise all the males in his household as a sign that they belong to God. He also promised to give Abraham and Sarah a child.
  Chapt. 18: God again visited Abraham and said that He would give him and Sarah a son, Isaac. Sarah heard the news and laughed. God heard her and said that He can do anything.

Application: |
  God wants relationship with us. When I trust Him, I show that I love Him. It is better to trust God than to try to fulfill my plans in my way like Abram and Sarai did. This story shows me how God wants to give me His promises in His time and that I need to wait for God to do what He promises.
  Hagar called God, “the God who sees”. He knows my needs and all that is going on with me. I know that He cares for me. So when God tells me to do something, I know that it is good and right because He sees and knows everything. God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael. They are the great Arab people and today, many of them are Muslim. God saw and heard Hagar when she was having a hard time. He saw and heard Abraham and  Sarah when they were waiting for God’s promise to give them Isaac. Jesus sees and hears me when I pray to Him. Prov. 15:29 “The Lord is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.” When I believe in Jesus, He puts His righteousness on me and then I can be with God and He hears my prayers. God cares for me.
  God promised many things to Abraham. God made a covenant with Abraham and gave him the sign of circumcision so they would understand that they are a special people that belong to God. This was a physical sign for the people. Today, God doesn’t require this. But the idea of belonging to God that circumcision demonstrated is important.  I belong to God and become His child through faith in Jesus Christ. Now the way that I live and what I value differs from the world’s values. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit to help me love God and to live His way.
  God promised to give Abraham and Sarah a son and He fulfilled His Word. I read the promises of God in the Bible and believe that God fulfills His Word. I trust God. Abraham and Sarah waited a long time for God to fulfill His promise. Sometimes, God wants me to wait until He fulfills His promise. For example, Jesus said that He will return to take believers to be with HIm. I believe that this is the truth, but in faith, I am waiting for His return.
