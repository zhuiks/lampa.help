Summary: |
  Miriam died. The people wanted water and God told Moses to SPEAK to the rock for Him to give them water. But Moses was angry at the people and struck the rock (see Ex. 17:1-7). Moses didn’t rightly represent God and didn’t do what God said (v. 12). Then God told Moses that he couldn’t lead the people into the promised land. Edom didn’t allow Israel to cross through their land. Aaron died.
  Ch. 21: Later, the people didn’t trust God and spoke against Him (v.5). He sent poisonous snakes that bit them. God told Moses to make a bronze snake and lift it up high on a pole. The people who looked at it were healed. Later, God gave them water and they sang a song “Spring up, well” (v. 17). God gave the people victory over their enemies, Sihon and Og.

  see also Jn. 3:14-15 “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15 so that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life.”

Application: |
  I can talk with Jesus and know that He hears me and helps me when I need something. I need to do things God’s way and not my way. When I sin, I can look to Jesus (turn to Him) and He forgives me, heals me and changes me.
  In this passage there are several pictures of Jesus. The Rock is a picture of Jesus. He was struck (on the cross) for me and I receive blessing and help from Him. now all that I need to do is speak with Jesus and He helps me. Jesus doesn’t need to be struck again. Striking the Rock to get water was needed only once and for all times. This demonstrates the one and only time when Jesus was struck and went to the cross so that I could receive help. Speaking to the Rock to receive water shows how the second time and everytime afterwards I can ask Jesus for help.
  The bronze snake is also a picture of Jesus. When I look to Jesus in faith that he took my sin and punishment upon Himself, I am saved. The bronze snake on the pole was a sign that the people’s sin was judged. Jesus carried my sin and was judged in my place on the cross. 2 Cor. 5:21 “He made the One who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” I can tell people that Jesus saves and forgives. They only need to ask Jesus and turn to Him in faith! He is Savior!
