Book: 'The Gospels: The Manifestation of Christ.'
Scripture: Matt. 16:13-28 through 17-1-27
Truth: Jesus is the Son of God
Verse: Matt. 16:15-16 “He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” 16 Simon Peter
  answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”  or Matt. 16:24:26
  “ Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him
  deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. 25 For whoever desires to save
  his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 26 For
  what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?
  Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?“
Summary: |-
  In Matt. 16:13-28, Jesus asked the disciples who they say He is. Peter correctly said that Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus told the disciples how He would soon be killed in Jerusalem and on the third day, rise. Peter didn’t agree and Jesus said ”Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.” (v.23) Jesus explained what it means to follow Him and that He will return one day with angels to judge the world and rule in His kingdom.
  17:1-13: Jesus and three of His disciples climbed a mountain and there Jesus was transfigured and shone very brightly. Moses and Elijah appeared and talked with Him. The disciples heard a voice from heaven saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” (v. 5) They were afraid. They asked Jesus about the prophecy which says that Elijah should come first. Jesus answered that Elijah would and has come. They understood that Jesus was speaking of John the Baptist.
  In verses 14-21, the disciples couldn’t heal a boy, but Jesus healed him. They asked why they couldn’t heal him. Jesus said, “Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.” (20-21)
  In verses 22-23 Jesus again spoke of His death and resurrection on the third day.
  In verses 24-27, people asked Jesus to pay the temple tax. He said that the kings’ sons are free from paying taxes and then told Peter to go catch a fish, find money in the fish’s mouth, and to pay the tax for Peter and Himself .
Character:
- Jesus is God
- Jesus is eternal
- Jesus fulfills prophecy
- Jesus is Healer
- Jesus knows everything
- Jesus knew that He would lay down His life at the cross and rise again on the third
  day
Application: |
  Jesus told the disciples in advance about His death and resurrection. He knew that He came to the world to give His life, to pay for my sin and the sin of all people. His transfiguration on the mountain and conversation with Moses and Elijah show me that Jesus is the Son of God, that He is eternal and that He fulfills the words of the Law (given by God through Moses) and prophecy (which Elijah represented). God’s plan to save humanity was from eternity. It was always His plan for me to know Him as my God and Savior. I want to tell everyone that Jesus is the Son of God who died for our sin and rose on the third day to forgive us and give us life in the knowledge of Him. I trust Jesus.
