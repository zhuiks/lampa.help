  Chapt. 23: Sarah died and Abraham bought a special place for her grave.
  Abraham sent his servant far away to the land of their relatives to find a wife for Isaac. The servant prayed for God’s help in finding Isaac’s wife. He prayed that the young woman who would give him and his camels water would be Isaac’s wife. Rebekah came and gave water to him and his camels. God answered his prayer. The servant met Rebekah and talked to her family about her becoming Isaac’s wife. Rebekah decided to leave her family and marry Isaac. Isaac loved Rebekah (v. 67).

Application: |
  God answers prayer. Abraham’s servant wasn’t sure what to do, but he asked God to help him and He did!  He prayed specifically to God. I can pray to God and he hears me.  He wisely gives me what is best for me at the right time. God knew that Rebecca would be at the well when Abraham’s servant was there praying.  God also knows all about my life, where I am and where I will be. He leads and guides me in life. __Jesus, thank You that you guide me, please help me to follow You! __
  Rebekah is a good example to me. She was ready to help and work hard to bring lots of water to the thirsty camels! Am I ready to help where there is a need? Jesus, give me a heart of love to see where I can help and give me strength to do it.  Rebecca agreed to be Isaac’s wife and travel to a far land to be with him. She didn’t see Isaac, but she heard about him and agreed to be his wife. I don’t see Jesus now, but I can agree to follow Him. When I learn about Him from the Bible, I love Jesus more and more. Jesus calls believers to live life with Him now and forever. Isaac loved his bride, Rebekah and Jesus loves His Bride, the Church. __Jesus, I love you and I’m waiting for your return!__
