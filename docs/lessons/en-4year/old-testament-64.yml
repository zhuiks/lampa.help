Summary: |-
  “The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:2 For learning what wisdom and discipline are; for understanding insightful sayings;3 for receiving wise instruction in righteousness, justice, and integrity; 4 for teaching shrewdness to the inexperienced,knowledge and discretion to a young man— 5 a wise man will listen and increase his learning, and a discerning man will obtain guidance—6 for understanding a proverb or a parable, the words of the wise, and their riddles.
  7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and discipline” (1:1-7)

  Wisdom calls out to people and offers to show the good way that leads to life. There is a wrong path which leads to death (1:20-33, ch.8-9). “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding; 6 think about Him in all your ways, and He will guide you on the right paths” (3:5-6).

Application: |
  God speaks to me through His Word. He offers me His Wisdom. The Bible teaches me how to live God’s way and not end up on the path that leads to death. When I need to make a decision, I can pray to Jesus and read the Bible to know what to do. God promises to guide me. I can seek God’s way for my life. I value Jesus and His ways. They are better than what the world offers, which is harmful and leads to death (Prov. 1:10-19). When a group plans to do something dishonest, I don’t want to participate with them because I love Jesus and His way. __Jesus, help me to follow You.__
