Summary: |
  Chapt. 20: Abraham and Sarah went to the land of king Abimelech. Abraham was afraid that the king would kill him and take his wife. He hid the truth that they were husband and wife. Abimelech took Sarah anyway because she was beautiful. But God protected Sarah and Abimelech didn’t touch her. God Himself told Abimelech that Sarah was Abraham’s wife. He returned her and asked him to leave his land.
  Chapt. 21: According to God’s word, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. Ishmael mocked (made fun of) Isaac. Sarah wanted them to leave. “Now this was a very difficult thing for Abraham because of his son.But God said to Abraham, “Do not be concerned  about the boy and your slave. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, because your offspring will be traced through Isaac. But I will also make a nation of the slave’s son because he is your offspring” (v.11-13). God took care of Hagar and Ishmael (v. 13, 19). See also Gal. 4:28-31.

Application: |
  Sometimes I may end up in a dangerous situation because of someone else’s decision. Sarah was in such a situation. God protected her in order to fulfill His plan and make her the mother of Isaac. God also can protect me in order to fulfill His plan for my life. Abraham was afraid of Abimelech and hid the truth. God wants me to fear Him alone and not people. I don’t need to hide anything. I can answer honestly and know that God is my help and defence!
  Abraham sent Ishmael away. According to Gal. 4:21-31, the lives of Ishmael and Isaac teach us about living according to the flesh and living according to the Spirit. A life lived in the flesh, by my strength and works (as Ishmael’s birth was according to the flesh) can’t please God and can’t live peacefully alongside that which is from God and according to His Word (as Isaac’s birth was according to the  promise). I can’t live both my way and God’s way. __Jesus, thank you that You save my by grace and free me from sin and death. Help me to love you and rely upon You and the power of Your Holy Spirit in all things.__
