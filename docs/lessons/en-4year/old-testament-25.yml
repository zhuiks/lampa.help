Summary: |-
  Chapt. 18: Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro,  came to him, bringing Moses’ wife and sons. Jethro worshipped God with Moses. He advised Moses to set up more leaders to help serve the people. He later went back home.
  Chapt. 19: God told Moses to invited the people to be His people. They cleansed themselves to prepare to meet with God. “On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the Lord came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.” (v.16-19). See also Heb. 12:18-24.
  Chatp. 20: God gave the 10 commandments to the Israelites: 1) You shall have no other gods before Me 2) You shall not make for yourself a carved image…you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. 3) You shall not take the name of God in vain 4) Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy 5) honor your mother and father 6) you shall not murder 7) you shall not commit adultery 8) You shall not steal 9) You shall not bear false witness 10) You shall not covet (Ex. 20:1-17). The people were afraid and wanted God to speak to Moses and not directly to them.
  Chapt. 21-24: God gave Moses specific laws about how the Israelites were supposed to live.
  Moses went up to Mt.Sinai for 40 days to receive the law.

Application: |
  God has made known to me his standard of holiness through his law but I myself in my own strength cannot fulfill the law. I am guilty of breaking God’s law and that’s why I need Jesus. Jesus fulfilled the law for me and when I believe in Him, He gives me his strength to live God’s way. He took my punishment for breaking God’s law when He died on the cross. When I believe in Him, He gives me His Holy Spirit that helps me to love and follow God.  Jesus gives me His righteousness. I don’t have righteousness of my own.  __Jesus, please help me to love God and live pleasing to Him.__
