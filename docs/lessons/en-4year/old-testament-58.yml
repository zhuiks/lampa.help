Summary: |
  Ch. 8: David fought against the enemies of Israel and God gave him victory. He didn’t take many horses for himself (see Deut. 17:16).
  Ch. 9: David looked for a relative of Saul and Jonathan’s whom he could help and show mercy. Earlier, David promised Jonathan that he and his family would always be friends. He found Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth, who was crippled. David invited him to always eat at his table and promised to care for him.
  Ch. 10: David sent his servants to offer their condolences to the king of the Ammonites when he heard that the king’s father died. However, the king was rude to David’s servants and this started a war between them. Israel’s army trusted in God (v.12) and God gave them the victory over their enemies.

  see also Ps. 61, 95 (attributed to David in Heb.4:7), 101, 110, 122, 124, 133, 138
  *Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not. You may want to read some of the psalms that could be from this period of David’s life.

Application: |
  I know that God shows me mercy. He sent Jesus, who died for me and forgives my sin when I trust in Him. Every day and every minute, he shows me mercy, love and care. I can praise Him and be thankful. I can show others mercy so that they would know about Jesus’ love. Just as David kept his work and helped the son of Jonathan, I know that God keeps His Word to save me and help me. Jesus helps me to keep my word when I promise to do something.
  God gave David and Israel victory over their enemies when they followed Him. Jesus wants to give me victory over sin that is my “enemy” in my life. Maybe that “enemy” is a bad habit or a harmful desire. When I seek Jesus and ask Him for help, He gives me strength to stand against sin and act God’s way (which is pleasing to Him.)
