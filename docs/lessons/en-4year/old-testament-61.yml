Summary: |+
  2:13-46: Solomon acted wisely towards the people who didn’t support his kingship.
  Ch. 3: God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, “Ask. What should I give you?” (v. 5). He asked God for wisdom because he was young and didn’t know how to lead the people. God was pleased with his request and God gave Solomon more wisdom than other people. He also promised to give him riches.
  Once, 2 women came to Solomon for judgement of their argument about to whom a baby belonged. One of the women lied. Solomon gave the order to cut the child in half but the real mother didn’t want her child to die and was ready to give him to the other woman whereas the other woman wanted him to die. Then Solomon knew who the real mother was and gave the baby to her. The people all saw the wisdom that God gave Solomon.
  Ch. 4: God gave Solomon riches, glory and wisdom. There was peace in the land. “Solomon composed 3,000 proverbs, and his songs numbered 1,005. 33 He described trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing out of the wall. He also taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 34 People came from everywhere, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, to listen to Solomon’s wisdom” (v.32-34).

  Ps. 72 (possibly David’s prayer for his son, Solomon)

  Song of Songs 8:6-7: Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death; ardent love is as unrelenting as Sheol. Love’s flames are fiery flames— the fiercest of all. 7 Mighty waters cannot extinguish love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all his wealth for love, it would be utterly scorned.”

Application: |
  I can ask God for wisdom and know that He will give it. Jesus, helps me to live pleasing to God and to not compromise. I don’t always remember what is right, but God knows and His Word tells me what is right. God knows what is in my heart and in the hearts of others. I should fear the Lord (respect and revere Him).
  Solomon wrote the Song of Songs which talks about the deep love between a husband and wife. We can understand this as a picture of Jesus and the Church. Jesus loves us so much that He gave His life for us.
  Solomon loved God but didn’t always follow Him. Even at the beginning of his reign, he allowed things that weren’t pleasing to God. See Deut. 17:14-17. Later, there were big problems. He 1) married a woman that didn’t worship God alone (1 Kings 3:1). 2) multiplied horses (1 Kings 4:26) and 3) gathered many riches (10:14 and 21).
  I understand that it’s easy to start to love God but I need His help to remain faithful. __Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to live and give me a heart that is ready to do what You teach me to do. Protect and guard me from the temptation to 1) love those that don’t love You more than I love You 2) trust in my own strength and not in You 3) find my security in riches instead of in You. Holy Spirit, help me to know and do what is pleasing to God and to express my love for Jesus. Teach me, when I read the Word, so I can know and fulfill what is wise and share God’s wisdom with people.__
