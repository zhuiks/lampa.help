Summary: |-
  “My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (James 1:2-5)

  “Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone” (James 1:12-13)

  “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.” (James 1:17)

  “So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; 20 for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.” (James 1:19-20)

  “ But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.” (James 1:22)

  “Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” (James 1:27)

Application: |
  I believe in Jesus and know that I will have trials that strengthen my faith in Jesus. God will help me and promises to give me wisdom and strength in every situation. God doesn’t tempt me but He sometimes tests me so that I would trust Him more and rely upon Him. God always has good intentions for my life. Jesus gives me wisdom to know how to live and follow Him. He helps me to listen to others and know what to say and not get angry. He gives me love for others and shows me how to fulfill what His Word says (for example to help widows and orphans and to live a pure life).
  I know that we people are all the same before God. That is, Jesus died for the poor and the rich and sees everyone the same. I also should treat all people with the same love and respect. I shouldn’t judge others or discriminate against them because I myself am imperfect. Only Jesus is perfect. By His mercy, Jesus paid for my sin and this is why “mercy triumphs over judgment.” When I believe in something or someone, my belief is manifested through what I do. Abraham and Rahab believed in God and I see their faith through what they did. My actions don’t save me. Only the perfect life of Jesus and His sacrifice on the cross saves me when I believe in Him and start to trust Him. Now because of my faith in Jesus, I want to live pleasing Him. He gives me strength and wisdom through the Holy Spirit and the Word to daily follow Him. __Jesus, please give me wisdom and love to endure trials, to be strengthened in faith and to love everyone as You love, through my life (in all that I do.)__
