Summary: |-
  Matt. 13:1-23 The Parable of the Sower. Luke 8:4-9, 11-15: “4 And when a great multitude had gathered, and they had come to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable: 5 “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it. 6 Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. 8 But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.” When He had said these things He cried, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”9 Then His disciples asked Him, saying, “What does this parable mean?”
  “11 “Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 12 Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 13 But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. 14 Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. 15 But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.” (Luke 8:4-9, 11-15)
  The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares (Matt. 13:24-30): Both wheat and tares (weeds) are growing together in the field. They will only be separated at harvest time, when the wheat is gathered to the barn and the tares are burned.
  The Parable of the Mustard Seed and Leaven (Matt. 13:31-36): Jesus compares the kingdom of Heaven to these things that start small and grow big.
  Explanation of the parable of the Wheat and the Tares (Matt. 13:37-43): At the end of the ages, God will judge people and determine who are like tares and who is like wheat. Unbelievers will be in hell and those who trust Jesus will be in the Kingdom of the Father.
  The Parable of Hidden Treasure and the Pearl (Matt. 13:44-46): The Kingdom of heaven is like that which is precious and valuable.
  The Parable of the Dragnet (Matt. 13:47-53): The kingdom of heaven is like a net that gathers all sorts of fish and things from the sea. At the end of the ages, God’s angels will separate the good from the bad, the wicked from the just. The wicked will be thrown into eternal fire.
  Parable of the Light (Mark 4:21-25): “For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light” (v. 22)
  (26-34): The kingdom of God is like seed that is sown, grows and is harvested. It’s also like a mustard seed that is tiny at first and grows to be very big.

Application: |
  God’s Word is the truth and I can believe it. The Word of God is stronger than any problem and I can trust Jesus with everything. God’s Word is more important and valuable than all riches. I can receive His Word with faith and live according to His Word. The Word speaks of Jesus, that He is the Son of God and the Son of Man (that is, He is both God and man). He is the only sinless One who fulfilled all of God’s Law on my behalf. He died on the cross and paid for my sin. He rose again and forgives the sin of those who trust Him. When I trust Him and His righteousness, He imparts His righteousness to me. This is why in these proverbs, the righteous are in the Heavenly Kingdom.God receives the righteous into His Kingdom. God prepared a fiery furnace for the unrighteous. People who don’t trust Jesus’ righteousness will be judged and will not be in God’s kingdom. Jesus reigns in the Heavenly Kingdom. I want to be in Jesus’ Kingdom. I don’t want unbelievers to be in the fiery furnace but I want to tell them about Jesus so that they would believe the Word and be in the Heavenly Kingdom. Jesus, help me to trust You and Your Word. Help me to sow the Word and share with people about You, that You are Savior and King.

  Other notes on the parables: Currently there are believers and unbelievers in Church but on the Day of Judgement, only believers will be with God. God’s Kingdom grows and influences those around us.
  The Heavenly Kingdom involves our relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ and it is most important and valuable.
