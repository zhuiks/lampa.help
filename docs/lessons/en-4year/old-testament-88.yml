Summary: |+
  1: Nebuchadnezzar took many people away from Judah when he conquered it. Daniel and his friends were some of those people. King Nebuchadnezzar had a special plan for Daniel and his friends. He wanted them to serve in his kingdom and wanted them to study the ways for Babylon for 3 years. He also gave them food from his table. But Daniel and his friends couldn’t eat the king’s food because it wasn’t clean according to God’s law. When Daniel asked to only eat vegetables and drink water, God gave them favor with the person in charge of them. He decided to test them for 10 days and the Babylonians saw that Daniel and his friends looked better than those who were eating the king’s food. Daniel and his friends continued to study and God gave them wisdom and knowledge. At the end of the 3 years, the king tested them and saw that Daniel and his friends were the best.

  Ch. 2: King Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream. He wanted to know what it meant. He wanted his wise men to tell him his dream and if they couldn’t, he would kill all of them. Daniel and his friends prayed to God for help. God told Daniel the king’s dream and it’s meaning. In the dream, there was a big statue made of different metals. In the end, a big rock destroyed the statue and became a big mountain that filled the earth. Daniel explained that the different metals were different kingdoms. The big Rock was God’s eternal kingdom that would destroy all the other ones and endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar said that Daniel’s God was the best and rewarded Daniel and his friends with good jobs serving him.

  Ch. 3: King Nebuchadnezzar made a huge idol and gathered the leaders from his kingdom so that they would worship it when the music played. The friends of Daniel: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were there. They did not worship the idol. Other people complained about them to the king. The king gave them another chance to bow to the idol and if not, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. But they said that their God could save them and even if He did allow them to die, they wouldn’t worship the idol. The king got angry and heated the furnace 7 times hotter. It was so hot that the people who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the furnace died from the heat. The king saw that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn’t die but that God saved them and that even One who looked like the Son of God was with them in the fire. He told them to come out and saw that even their hair and clothing was not burned by the fire. Then the king praised God and wanted all his people to respect God (v. 28-29).

Application: |
  Daniel and his friends trusted God and did what was pleasing to Him. They loved God and that’s why they didn’t want to eat the king’s food.  Jesus, help me to follow You even when “important” people are telling me to do something else. People saw that following God was good. Jesus is glorified (seen as great) in my life when I follow Him.
  Daniel knew that God knows everything and that He rules over and controls everything. He knew that God could tell him the king’s dream. The king then understood that God is the greatest. When I follow Jesus and look to Him for help, others see that He is great. Jesus is the big rock in the king’s dream that will get rid of all the other kingdoms and rule forever. He is big and strong and He rules over everything and everyone__. Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because You are great and Your kingdom is forever.__
  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in a very difficult situation. In the face of death, they chose to worship God alone. When I am in difficult circumstances, Jesus helps me to not compromise or do what is displeasing to God. The One like the Son of God was with them in the furnace. Jesus, the Son of God, is with me when unbelievers threaten me. Often, when I follow Jesus, unbelievers will understand later that God is great and worthy of praise.
