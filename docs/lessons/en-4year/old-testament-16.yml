Summary: |-
  Jacob leaves his family because he is afraid that his brother will hurt him. His parents send him to his mom’s relatives who live far away. On the way there, God speaks to Jacob, showing him a ladder going from heaven to earth and promises to give Jacob the land that He promised to Abraham and to be with him. Jacob goes to live with his uncle Laban. Laban tricked Jacob into marrying his older daughter instead of the younger daughter that he promised him. Jacob marries the younger daughter too. He takes 2 more wives. God gives Jacob many children.

  See also Gen. 22:17-18 and 26:4 for God’s promises of blessing and family to Abraham and Isaac.
Character:
- God is with us
- God is faithful
- God keeps his Word
- He is honest
- He is holy
- God has good plans for me
- Jesus came from heaven to earth to connect us to God (like the ladder in Jacob’s
  dream)
Application: |
  God showed Jacob a ladder between heaven and earth. Jesus is like this ladder because He came down from heaven to earth so that we could be with God in heaven. Through Jesus, I can come to God and He receives me.
  God was with Jacob, just as He promised. He is also with me. God fulfills His promises to me. What promises are in the Bible? He promises to love me, forgive my sin, bring me to heaven to live with him, give me the Holy Spirit for wisdom, help, strength and comfort. I trust Jesus.
  Jacob had many problems in his family because he had many wives and he was deceptive (tricky). God wants a husband to have only one wife (Gen 2:24). Jacob had many wives and because of that there was jealousy and envy in the family. God gave Jacob many children. This was the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18) and Isaac (Gen. 26:4). __Jesus, help me to be honest and help me to have good family relationships.__
