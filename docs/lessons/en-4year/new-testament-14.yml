  “So Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum” (v. 46). The man asked Jesus to come to his home to heal his son. Jesus simply said the word that his son was healed. The man believed Jesus’ word and continued home. Along the way, he heard that his son was already healthy and understood that Jesus had healed him. As a result, he and his whole household believed (v. 53).

Application: |
  I believe that Jesus is God. All that He says, takes place. He can heal someone by a word. I know that He hears my prayers and that He can heal me or someone else. The people in this passage believed Jesus’ word. I also believe Jesus’ words. The Bible is God’s Word and I can believe everything that is written there. Sometimes people don’t want to know Jesus and don’t want to believe His Word. Sometimes they only want to see miracles.
  __Jesus, help me to trust You because You answer my prayers. You can do all things because You are God. Help me to love You and not just love what You do. Your works are great and I am thankful to You for all that you do and promise to do. Your works show me that you are loving, almighty, wise and faithful. I want to tell everyone about You, Jesus, because you alone are Savior.__
