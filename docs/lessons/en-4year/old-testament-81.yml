Summary: |+
  Ch.40: God comforts His people and promises to be their shepherd. Verse 8, “The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.” God is the Living God and is not like idols, which are made my people’s hands. v. 29-31 “He gives strength to the weary and strengthens the powerless. 30 Youths may faint and grow weary, and young men stumble and fall, 31 but those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength; they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not faint.”
  Ch. 41: In verses 10 and 13, God says that He helps His people and that they shouldn’t be afraid. Idols can’t help people.
  Ch. 42: This describes the Savior. (see also Matt. 12:20)
  Ch. 43: God has a special plan for Israel. v 11 “I, I am Yahweh, and there is no other Savior but Me”
  *Ch. 44: God says ahead of time that He will free Israel from captivity and return them to their land. Those who trust in idols are foolish (v. 9-22). God names the king (Cyrus) who will fulfill His will and give the order for His people to return to their land.
  Ch. 45: God declares salvation to the nations. Verse 22 “Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth. For I am God, and there is no other.”

  Ch. 50:10 A description of how the Messiah would suffer and save.
  Ch. 51: God reminds Israel of their past relationship with Him. Verse 6 speaks about the end of the world. His wrath is upon those who are against Him and His people.
  Ch. 52: God promises to redeem people from captivity. Good news. Verse 7: “How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the herald, who proclaims peace, who brings news of good things, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!” Verses 11-12 speak of them leaving captivity: “Leave, leave, go out from there! Do not touch anything unclean; go out from her, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the Lord. 12 For you will not leave in a hurry, and you will not have to take flight; because the Lord is going before you, and the God of Israel is your rear guard.”

Application: |
  In these chapters, I see that God always had a plan to send Jesus to earth to save us. He is the only One who can free me from sin. Israel went into captivity because of their sin. They didn’t love God, didn’t listen to His Word and worshipped idols. God alone is worthy of worship. He is worthy of obedience and He hates idol worship*. God punished His people sending them to Babylon for a time. My sin separates me from God when I don’t listen to His Word. I am not loving God when I live my own way. But God promised to return Israel to the land and told them many years ahead of time so that they would know that it was God who freed them. I can draw near to God through faith in Jesus, knowing that He paid for my sin. There will be a day when God will punish all those who don’t believe in Jesus. He will pour out His wrath on the earth but those who trust in Jesus will be with Him forever, where everything is wonderful. I want to trust Jesus now. I want to tell people about Jesus, so that they won’t have to experience God’s wrath. I can tell people that Jesus is the only Savior. __God help me to trust you, follow You and tell people about salvation in Jesus.__
  About the prophets:
  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.
