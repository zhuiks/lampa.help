Number: 19
Title: The Sermon on the Mount
Book: 'The Gospel of Matthew: The Manifestation of Christ as King.'
Scripture: Matt. 7
Truth: Jesus calls us to listen to and fulfill His Word
Verse: Matt. 7:24 “Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I
  will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock”
Summary: |
  Don’t judge (v. 1-5). Pearl: Don’t give that which is precious to those who do not value it (v.6). Ask: The Heavenly Father invites people to seek, knock and ask Him and He promises to answer (v. 7-11). Salvation and sincere faith: “ Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.” (v.12). There are 2 paths in life and only one of them leads to life. The way people live shows if they sincerely love God or not. Jesus knows the hearts of those who believe in Him.
  Those who do what Jesus says are like a wise person who builds his house upon a rock. In times of trouble, the house stands. Those who don’t fulfill Jesus’ words are like a foolish person who builds his house upon the sand. When troubles come, the house falls (v. 12-27). Jesus finished the sermon on the mountain and people said that he taught with authority (v.28-29).
Character:
- Jesus has authority
- Jesus is God
- Jesus is Judge
- God knows all hearts
Application: |
  Jesus is sinless and He has the right to judge people because He sees everything correctly. I can’t judge because I myself am a sinner and can’t see everything correctly.
  I need to ask Jesus for wisdom, to know how to share the truth (that is, what is precious) with people. I shouldn’t throw pearls to the swine because they really will trample them. For example, Jesus didn’t answer king Herod’s questions, but was silent because He knew what was in Herod’s heart. I don’t know what is in people’s hearts, but I know that Jesus can show me what to say and how to say it to different people in order to share about salvation through faith in Him. Jesus wants me to share the truth with people but He also wants me to rely upon the leading of the Holy Spirit in how to share.
  The Heavenly Father wants me to ask of Him, seek His will and knock, coming to be with Him. When I ask of Him, by this I am showing that I trust Him and understand that He is my help. He promises to answer! He hears my prayers. I can find Him. The Bible is full of answers and promises from God.
  Jesus gave me the “golden rule”, that is: I should treat others the way that I want them to treat me. I want people to love me just as Jesus loves me. It then follows that I should love them just as Jesus loved them. His love is the best and the strongest. Jesus helps me to love others.
  There are only 2 paths in life. Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the LIfe (Jn. 14:6). When I believe in Jesus, I am in the way of life. Jesus is the only way to life. That’s why it is written that the gate and the path is narrow. The other path is easy and wide, but it leads to death. __Jesus, help me to follow You and tell people that You are the path of Life!__
  Sometimes people say that they believe, but their words and deeds don’t match up. Jesus, help me to learn from what you teach. Jesus gave the example of a tree in order to understand what a person’s life looks like. What “grows from” or comes out of a person’s life (like fruit grows on a tree or comes from a tree), shows what that person is like.
  Jesus says that some people think that He will receive them, but they really are doing their works before people and not before God. This is why Jesus will say to them “I never knew you.” __Jesus, help me to be sincere and do everything for You and not for my own glory.__
  I want to be wise and not only hear, but fulfill Jesus’ Words. How can I “build my house” (that is build my life) on the rock (that is on Jesus)? I can listen to God’s Word in church and read it myself. I can pray to Jesus and ask Him to lead my by the Holy Spirit each day. I can do what He teaches me to do in His Word. First I hear about something and then I do it with the help of the Holy Spirit!
