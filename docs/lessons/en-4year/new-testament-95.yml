Summary: |
  Ch. 1: John himself saw Jesus and fellowshiped with Him. He wanted other believers to also have fellowship with one another, with God the Father and with Jesus. He wrote this letter so that their joy would be complete (1:4). God is light. Believers walk in the light and have fellowship with God. The blood of Jesus cleanses from sin. All people sin, but “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1:9).

  Ch. 2: John wrote this letter so that people wouldn’t continue in sin (2:1). But if someone sinned, Jesus intercedes for them. He is the propitiation for the sin of the whole world (the One who turned the wrath of God away and paid for sin with His blood). Believers can have confidence that they belong to God if they keep the Word and abide in Him. “The one who says he remains in Him should walk just as He walked.“ (2:6). Faith in Jesus changes how believers live.They love other believers when they love God. “Do not love the world or the things that belong to  the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. 16 For everything that belongs to the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s lifestyle—is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does God’s will remains forever.“ (2:15-17). The antichrist doesn’t believe in the Father and the Son. God promised believers eternal life, gave them an anointing and called them to be with Him. They abide in Him and are not ashamed in His presence. He is the Righteous One and those who do right things have received new life in Him.

  Ch. 3: “ Look at how great a love the Father has given us that we should be called God’s children. And we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn’t know Him.“ (3:1). Believers live in purity and don’t sin because their hope is in Him. Jesus destroyed the works of the devil. Those who love God and other believers don’t continue sinning. Believers love one another. The world hates believers. Believers love their brothers and follow Jesus’ example. They love with actions and not only words. Believers believe in Jesus, abide in HIm, fulfill His commandments and know that He is in them because He gave them the Holy Spirit (3:24).

  Ch. 4: False prophets don’t believe that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. There is a Spirit of truth and a spirit of deception. “Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent His One and Only Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another.“ (4:7-11).  God gave believers the Holy Spirit and we know that we abide in Him. “ Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God—God remains in him and he in God.“ (4:15). Believers don’t fear judgement day because they know that Jesus paid for their sin and His perfect love drives out all fear. “We love because He first loved us.“ (4:19).

  Ch. 5: Believers believe in Jesus, love others and live according to God’s Word. “… whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith. 5 And who is the one who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?“ (5:4-5). “The one who has the Son has life. The one who doesn’t have the Son of God does not have life.“ (5:12). John wrote this letter to believers in Jesus so that they would know that they have eternal life (5:13). Believers have confidence that God answers their prayers when they pray according to God’s will. (5:14). Believers don’t continue sinning because God keeps them. “And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true One. We are in the true One—that is, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. Little children, guard yourselves from idols.“ (5:20-21).

Application: |
  Believers believe in Jesus, love others and live according to the Word of God.  Do I believe in Jesus? Do I have confidence in my salvation? Do I love other believers? Do I live according to God’s Word?
  When I believe in Jesus, I have fellowship with believers and with God. The way I live (pleasing to God or the way people in the world live) shows if I’m truly saved. Of course each person is a sinner and sins, but if I believe in Jesus and love HIm, I don’t continue sinning. For example, if I have a problem telling the truth and I constantly lie, I can ask Jesus to help me to speak the truth. He will help. But if I lie over and over again and don’t turn to Jesus for help then my salvation is under question. Do I understand the love of Jesus, His sacrifice on the cross and His power to help me live right?
  When I am saved, I love other believers. I show my love not only in words but in actions. If I don’t love my brother (another believer). that means that I don’t understand and don’t have God’s love. __Jesus, show me my heart and give me love for You and others. I want to love you and other more and more. __
