Summary: |+
  Ch. 12: Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, became king after the death of his father. The people of Israel gathered to ask him to make their work easier. Rehoboam didn’t listen to the wise advice of the older people and answered the people harshly. Then, 10 of the tribes left Rehoboam and became the northern kingdom (Israel). Rehoboam remained king of the southern kingdom (Judah). In Israel, Jeroboam became king.
  Ch. 13: Jeroboam sinned and made 2 golden calves in Israel (one in the north and one in the south) for people to worship God and not go to Jerusalem. But God sent him a prophet who said that this was wrong. The prophet was supposed to home right away by a different road but he listened to a deceitful person and stayed for a little while. Because of his disobedience, he died on the way home.
  Ch. 14: Jeroboam’s son was ill and he sent his wife to a prophet to know if he would get better. The prophet said that God judged Jeroboam for his disobedience. In Judah, the people started to worship different gods and God was angry. This was an abomination to the Lord. Also, Pharaoh came to Jerusalem and stole their treasures.
  2 Chron 12:1-2: “When Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he abandoned the law of the Lord—he and all Israel with him. 2 Because they were unfaithful to the Lord, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem”
  2 Chron. 12:6-8 “So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “Yahweh is righteous.”7 When the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, the Lord’s message came to Shemaiah: “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them but will grant them a little deliverance…However, they will become his servants so that they may recognize the difference between serving Me and serving the kingdoms of other lands.”

Application: |
  God wants me to worship Him alone. He is the most important and not me or other things that the world considers important. If God gives me a responsibility, I need to trust Him and follow Him in fulfilling it and not try to do things my own way. The kings of Judah and Israel influenced the spiritual lives of the people in their kingdom. I also influence the people around me. When I am trusting Jesus and following Him, things will be better for me and the people around me. __Jesus, help me to worship You with my life and to point to You and Your goodness, strength and wisdom in all I say and do. I pray that the people in my life (friends and family) would turn to You and worship You. __
