  Ps. 137:1 “By the rivers of Babylon— there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion”
  Lamentations: Jeremiah writes about the fall of Jerusalem. There is a word of comfort in 3:22-23 “Because of the Lord’s faithful love we do not perish,for His mercies never end. 23 They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness! I say: The Lord is my portion, therefore I will put my hope in Him.”
  Jer. 40-44: Jeremiah was being led away in chains with the captives of Judah when the Babylonian captain of the guard released him and let him chose if he would go to Babylon or stay behind. He decided to stay in the land where Gedaliah was governor of Judah. Gedaliah told the people to not fear the Chaldeans. Many Judeans who had fled to surrounding areas came back to the land. Gedaliah was warned by Johanan that someone wanted to kill him, but he didn’t believe the report.
  Ch. 41: Ishmael the Ammonite killed Gedaliah and those who had political connections in Judah. Johanan fought against Ishmael and rescued the people that Ishmael had taken captive. Johanan’s group wanted to run away to Egypt because they were afraid of the Chaldeans.
  Ch. 42: The people asked Jeremiah to pray to God, in order to know if they should go to Egypt or not. After 10 days, Jeremiah shared that God told them not to go to Egypt. He told them not to fear the king of Babylon and that He wanted to show them mercy and save and deliver them. God warned them that those who went to Egypt would encounter war, famine and plague.
  Ch. 43: However, Johanan said that Jeremiah was lying and led the remnant of Judah to Egypt. He made Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch go to Egypt with them. God told Jeremiah that Babylon would conquer Egypt and burn their temples.
  Ch. 44: Jeremiah spoke to the Judeans in Egypt. He said that they shouldn’t worship the Egyptian idols. But the people said that they wanted to worship the idols. Then God said that he would punish them.

  2 Kings 25:22-30: Gedaliah was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar as governor of Judah and told the people not to fear the Chaldeans (people from Babylon). But he was killed and a group ran away to Egypt because they were afraid of the Chaldeans (see Jer. 43:4-7).
  In “the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.” (v. 27).

Application: |
  God was faithful to warn the people and call them to repentance. He is also faithful to speak to me through His Word. The people didn’t want to hear God’s Word and called Jeremiah a liar Jesus, help me to believe and follow Your Word. Jeremiah suffered at the hands of evil people who didn’t believe God’s Word but God helped Him just as He promised. Maybe some people also treat me poorly because I believe in Jesus and talk about Him. But I know that Jesus is always with me. He is my help. Jesus even said “You are blessed when they insult and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me. 12 Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you “ (Matt. 5:11-12).
  Jeremiah knew that God is the most important and that He is worthy of his obedience. I also believe that Jesus is the most important and He is worthy of my obedience. He gave His life for me and forgives my sin. I know that He loves me and I love Him! In Lamentations 3:24, Jeremiah said that God is His portion and that he put his hope in HIm. Even when Jeremiah’s homeland was destroyed and he was taken away to Egypt, he knew that God was his portion and hope. This world changes all the time, but God’s kingdom is eternal and He has a reward, a portion, an inheritance and a place prepared for all those who love Jesus. We have a living hope (1Pet. 1:3) in Christ Jesus. We are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Heb. 12:28) and are looking ahead for the city that endures (Heb. 13:14 ), the New Jerusalem, where we will be with Jesus forever.
