Summary: |+
  There had already been drought in the land for 3 years. God told Elijah to return to Israel and talk with king Ahab. He gathered all the people and the prophets of Baal (a false god) on Mount Carmel. He said that they would see who the true God is. The people who worshipped Baal would bring a sacrifice to him and Elijah would sacrifice to God. The one who answered the sacrifice with fire from heaven was the true God. The prophets of Baal cried out to him all day long but nothing happened. Then Elijah gathered the people near the altar, dug a ditch around it and poured water over the altar 3 times until the water filled the ditch. He prayed to God and asked Him to show the people that He is the Only God. God answered with fire from heaven and all the people fell on their faces and cried out “the Lord, He is God!” Then they killed the false prophets.

  When Jezebel, the wife of king Ahab, heard that the prophets of Baal had been killed, she was angry with Elijah and sent him a message that she wanted to kill him. Elijah got scared and ran away to the south. He wanted to give up and die but God sent an angel who fed him and strengthened him to walk 40 days and 40 nights to Mount Horeb (Sinai). He found a cave and there heard God’s voice asking him “what are you doing here, Elijah?” He told God that he was the only believer and that he was scared for his life. God showed him a mighty wind, earthquake and fire but the Lord was not in those things. Then there was a soft whisper. God again spoke to Elijah and asked “what are you doing here, Elijah?” Elijah answered the same as before. God sent Elijah north to anoint kings in Syria and Israel. He also wanted Elijah to anoint Elisha to be prophet in his place. God also told him that he wasn’t alone but that there were still 7 thousand people in Israel who had not worshiped the false god, Baal. Elijah found Elisha. Elisha left his old life to follow God’s calling.

Application: |
  I know that God is the Only God and the One way of salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ. God used Elijah to show people that He is God. He can use even me to show people that Jesus is God. Even if I am the only one in a crowd of people who believes in Jesus, I can be sure that God is with me and He alone is worthy of worship.
  Elijah felt scared and alone when Jezebel threatened him. God took care of Elijah and spoke to him. Elijah wanted to give up and die, but the Mighty God who miraculously sent fire from heaven on Mt. Carmel and showed Elijah the wind, earthquake and fire spoke to him in a still quiet whisper. He gave Elijah new instructions for continuing to love and serve Him with His life. He reminded Elijah that he really wasn’t alone. Jesus is near to me when I am scared and feel alone. He provides for all my needs. He speaks to me through His Word, by His Spirit. He is the Mighty God of Wonders and yet He is the Good Shepherd who leads me to quiet waters and restores my soul. __Jesus, thank you, for Your constant presence with me, for Your great love and care. Help me to trust You. Thank you that just like Elijah, I can go to be with you all by myself and You are near to me and speak to me. Strengthen me to continue to walk with you all of my days. You alone are God!__
