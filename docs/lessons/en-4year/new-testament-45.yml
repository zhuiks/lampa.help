Summary: |-
  In Matt 22:1-14, Jesus told a parable of the wedding feast. Many guests were invited to the wedding feast of the king’s son, but they didn’t want to come and treated the king’s servants rudely. He punished them and invited other people from the streets. At the feast, the king saw one person who wasn’t dressed in the wedding clothes and asked him why this was, but the person was speechless. The king gave a command to throw him into outer darkness.

  In verses 15-22, people deceitfully asked Jesus about His attitude towards taxes. He said “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” (v.21)

  23-33 The Sadducees (a religious group of people) didn’t believe in the resurrection and asked Jesus about it. He quoted Scripture saying, “‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.” (v.32)

  34-40 A lawyer wanted to test Jesus and asked: what is the greatest commandment? “Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.” (v. 37-40)

  41-46 Jesus asked them how they understand whose son the Messiah is from Ps. 110:1 where David wrote, “The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.”They couldn’t answer Him.

  Matt. 23:1-36 Jesus said, “woe to you Pharisees and scribes” He taught that people shouldn’t be like them. Rather,“… he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” (v.11-12) He said that they hindered people from coming to God. They kept the law but, “have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone” (v.23) They took care of the outer appearance but God wants the heart to be clean. Worst of all, they rejected the Word of God just as those who lived earlier, who killed God’s prophets.

  37-39 Jesus said that Jerusalem is the city that doesn’t receive God’s truth and will be punished. He said, “ for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ (v.39)

Application: |
  In these chapters, Jesus speaks with the Pharisees and scribes who knew God’s Word very well. But they didn’t follow God’s Word. They rejected the truth of the Word and didn’t fulfill the greatest commandment: love God and others. They rejected Jesus, the Messiah (Savior). They loved the glory and praise of man and didn’t want to give glory to God. They thought that through keeping the Law, they would be accepted by God. But they relied upon their own righteousness, not knowing that their righteousness was sin in God’s eyes. (in the parable of the wedding feast, the wedding clothes represent Jesus’ righteousness). Only Jesus’ righteousness can save me so that I can be with God! My good deeds can’t save me. Jesus wants me to trust His righteousness. He wants me to love Him and others. When I trust Him and His righteousness, He gives me a new heart and He gives me the Holy Spirit. I am a new creation and I know that I am saved by grace. I don’t want glory for myself anymore but want to give glory to Jesus! I believe in God’s Word. I want to love others in Jesus’ name.
  __Jesus, help me to not live for pleasing people and myself by doing good deeds in self-righteousness. Help me to always remember that You are my Righteousness and that You save me by grace. Thank you, that you saved me!__
