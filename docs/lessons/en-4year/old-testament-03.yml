Summary: |+
  God placed Adam and Eve in a garden and gave them all the trees,  but God had  told Adam not to eat from one tree (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil), or he would die (Gen. 2:17). Satan, in the form of a snake* , deceived Eve and she ate the fruit from the forbidden tree and gave some to Adam to eat. Right away, they knew they were guilty and hid from God. They covered themselves with leaves (as clothing) but God covered their guilt with the skin of an animal.  God made them leave the garden but promised to send a Saviour through a child of a woman (3:15) .

  *see Rev. 12:9

Character:
- God is Holy
- God disciplines His children
- God is Savior
- Only God can cover and take away our sin
Application: |
  God gave Adam and Eve all that they needed and warned them of the danger of disobedience. Disobedience is sin and breaks our fellowship with God. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they died spiritually (not physically). Eve listened to the serpent’s lie and she didn’t trust God’s words. I should not listen to the lie, if someone says that God’s Word is not true or right.
  Adam and Eve sinned. What does this mean? Sin is when we love something or someone else more than God. Sin is a heart condition. In my own strength, I can’t love God most of all. I need help.God helped Adam and Eve when He covered them with the skin of an animal to show them that sin leads to death and that sin must be paid for with a Life. He promised them a Saviour (Gen. 3:15) and God fulfilled His promise by sending Jesus to save us. Because of Adam and Eve’s sin, all people became sinful from birth. But through faith in Jesus, I can be born again from above and Jesus gives me His righteousness. Rom. 5:19 says, “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.”  I need a Saviour, I need Jesus.  I need to ask God to forgive my sins. Jesus never sinned and so He could take the punishment for my sin upon Himself. He rose to life and so He conquered sin and death. __Thank you God for the death and resurrection of Jesus.__
