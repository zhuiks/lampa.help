Summary: |-
  When John the Baptist saw Jesus, He said “Look, the Lamb of God”. His disciples heard this and followed Jesus. Jesus asked them what they wanted. They wanted to know where He was staying. He said, “Come and see.” Andrew followed Jesus and brought his brother Simon to Jesus, saying, “we have found the Messiah!” (which means “Christ” or “anointed one”).
  Jesus gave Simon and new name: Peter. Jesus called Philip saying, “follow Me. (v. 43). Philip invited Nathanael to follow Jesus. “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” (v. 45). Nathanael didn’t believe that Jesus could be special because He grew up in Nazareth. But Philip repeated Jesus’ words, saying “Come and see.” When Jesus met Nathanael, He told him that he saw him sitting under a tree earlier, even though He hadn’t been with him.  Nathanael answered, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” (v. 49). But Jesus answered, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” 51 And He said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.” (v. 50-51).
  (see Gen. 28:12, Luke 5:1-11, 6:12-16 and Mark 1:17, 2:14)

Application: |
  Jesus invites me to follow Him. He wants me to be where He is. But how can I be where Jesus is when He is in heaven? I can’t literally follow Jesus like Andrew and John! He wants me to know Him more and more, to love others as He loves and to do what He does. He wants me to follow His example. If someone is sad, we sometimes say, “Jesus is with you. He can comfort you.” But maybe Jesus wants that person to sense God’s care, comfort and love through my friendship with them. Then, through me,  that person can understand that Jesus is near to them. Then, I am in the place where Jesus is.
  Some people hear about Jesus through relatives or friends (for example, Andrew told his brother, Simon-Peter). Some people don’t want to get to know Jesus initially (like Nathanael). Some believe that Jesus is the Messiah, Son of God, King and the One spoken of by the prophets and Moses. From whom or where did I hear about Jesus? Have I heard that Jesus invites me to follow Him? Have I told anyone else about Jesus, so that they too could follow Him? How can I follow Jesus? Jesus wants me to know Him and to become like Him. Do I know this? As I follow Jesus, I see how He changes me. Jesus gave Simon a new name to show that He would change his character for the better. I want to follow Jesus. He helps me to read the Bible, pray to Him and do what He shows me to do. His Holy Spirit will tell me what to do and say. How can I follow Him today?
