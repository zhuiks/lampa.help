Summary: |
  Paul went to Jerusalem and was arrested there for his faith in Jesus. God gave him an opportunity to share about salvation in Jesus with many kinds and leaders during the time when he was imprisoned and waited for the decision about his case in court. Paul was a Roman citizen and had a right to speak with the Roman king (Caesar) about his case. The governor allowed this and sent him to Caesar. (Acts 25:12)
  Paul (a prisoner for his faith in Jesus) sailed on the ship with other prisoners. Some of Paul’s friends sailed with him. Paul knew that the weather was bad for traveling but the captain decided to sail. They ended up in a storm that lasted for 2 weeks! God sent His angel to Paul who said, “Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you” (27:24). Paul believed God’s word and encouraged everyone. There was a shipwreck and all 276 people made it to shore on the island of Malta. The Maltese helped them to build a fire. When Paul was helping, a snake bit him and hung on his arm! All the locals thought that this was punishment from God but Paul didn’t get sick from the snake bite. God healed people on the island through Paul.
  Then they traveled on to Rome. There Paul lived in a house with soldiers while he waited for his court case. He gathered with the Jews and told them about Jesus. Some believed and some didn’t. Paul said that God wants to save the Gentiles too. “Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.” (28:30-31).

Application: |
  Paul became a prisoner for his faith in Jesus. He saw that God had a plan for him. He didn’t stop talking to people about Jesus even when he was a prisoner. I know that God has a good plan for my life which He wants to fulfill. Wherever I am, I can be sure that Jesus is with me, that He is my help and that nothing can stop God from fulfilling His plan. __Jesus, help me to tell people about Your love and about how You want to forgive their sins and give them new life in You.__
  Sometimes Paul was in scary situations but Jesus always was with him and helped him to boldly share about Him. Jesus, help me to not be afraid but to trust You and always boldly tell people that You are Saviour. When Paul shared, some people believed in Jesus and some didn’t. When I share about Jesus, some people will believe in Him and some will not. I must simply tell the truth and pray that God would save them. I want to pray for the salvation of ______________ (name).
  God wants to save everyone from every people group. Paul was Jewish and when he traveled, he began by telling the Jews about Jesus. But he also shared with the Gentiles and many of them believed in Jesus. Maybe it’s easy for me to tell people of my our nationality about Jesus, and maybe it’s hard. Jesus will lead me and show me who to share with and how.
  __Jesus, I know that You want everyone to know You. In heaven, people from all different nations, tribes and languages will praise You! Thank you that you are always with me. Lead me and use my life so that many people and many nations would love You and worship You! You are worthy!__
