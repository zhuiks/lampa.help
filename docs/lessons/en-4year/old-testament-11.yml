Summary: |-
  Chapt. 18:16-33   After God promised Abraham and Sarah a son, He told Abraham that he would destroy all the evil people in the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. He heard how people were crying to Him for help and He answered. Abraham reverently asked the Lord if He would destroy the righteous along with the wicked (v.25). God said that He would spare the city, even if there were only 10 righteous people in it.
  Chapt. 19: God send His angels to Lot’s house to save him and his family from His wrath upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot’s wife didn’t listen to the angel’s command to not look back while the city was being destroyed. She turned into a pillar of salt and died.*
  (*maybe because of salt blowing in her face)

Application: |
  God destroyed the cities of the evil people. I know that God will punish sin and that one day He will judge all unbelievers. Those who don’t love Jesus will go to hell where there is eternal torment. I don’t want anyone to go to hell and this is why I tell people about Jesus. Only He is Savior and can forgive sin and give us a new heart. Jesus promises to save all who believe in Him from God’s wrath. When I believe in Him, He gives me His righteousness and I am accepted by God.
  Lot’s wife was disobedient and looked back. She died. __Jesus, help me to be obedient to you, to the Word, and to find life in You! You led Lot and his family out of the dangerous city when You judged it. Help me to follow You and run from sin and “dangerous” places. Thank you that Your Holy Spirit speaks to me when I need to get out of a place that is dangerous. Thank you that in Your mercy and grace You save me from Your wrath by faith in Jesus. Thank you that by faith in Jesus, I am righteous in Your sight.__
