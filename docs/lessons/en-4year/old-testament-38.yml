Summary: |
  The 40 years of punishment were finished. Moses had died. Joshua is the leader of Israel. God told him again and again not to fear, to be obedient and to take the land. God promises to be with him. God told the people to go into the promised land. A new group of spies went into the land and hid in the house of Rahab, in the city of Jericho. Rahab heard about God and believed that He is mighty. The spies promised to save her and her family if she would hang a red cord in her window, so they could remember which house was hers.
  The Israelites were ready to cross over into the promised land and God told them to cross the Jordan river. God promised to stop the water when they stepped into the river so that they could safely cross over to the other side. And God did it! The people set up stones to remember what God did there.
  God tells the new generation to be circumcised according to the law. The people celebrate Passover. They eat food from the land and stopped receiving manna.  Joshua meets the commander of the Lord’s army who tells him how to conquer the city.
  Jericho was a huge city with big thick walls. God told the people to silently march around the city of Jericho once for 6 days and on the 7th day to march around the city 7 times and then to blow their trumpets. Then the walls around the city of Jericho came falling down!  God gave the city to the Israelites and the people saw that God is great and mighty. Rahab and her family were saved out of the city because she hung the red cord in her window.

  see also Heb 11:30-31 “By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after being encircled by the Israelites for seven days. 31 By faith Rahab the prostitute received the spies in peace and didn’t perish with those who disobeyed.”
Character:
- God is powerful! God keeps His promises

- God can do the impossible
- God is the strongest! Nothing and no one is stronger than God
- Jesus is the commander of the Lord’s army
Application: |
  God told the people to do something that seemed impossible. Jericho was a huge city with big thick walls but God was stronger than the walls! Even when something seems impossible, I know that with God nothing is impossible. I believe that God is powerful.  Rahab believed in God and put the red cord in her window. The red cord reminds me of the blood over the windows at Passover and of Jesus’ blood. Just as God saved Rahab, He saves me when I believe that Jesus’ paid for my sin with His blood.
  Jesus is eternal and sometimes we read about Him in the Old Testament. Jesus is the commander of the Lord’s army. I believe that He will return to take believers to be with Him and to judge and punish the sinful world. I want to tell people about Jesus so that they would trust Him and not be judged by God. Jesus is mighty to save!
