Application: |
  People came to Jesus because  they knew that He could help. I also can ask Jesus for help. Jesus has compassion and love for those who suffer (in this passage, the widow and the leper). He wanted to help them. He also wants to help and heal me, my family and friends. I know that Jesus loves me. I can pray to Jesus and ask Him for help.
  The centurion knew that Jesus had authority and when He said something, it would happen. He knew that Jesus didn’t need to physically be present for his servant to be healed. I don’t see Jesus with my eyes right now but I believe that He hears my prayers, He sees my needs and He is always with me. Jesus was amazed when He heard of the centurion’s faith. Jesus loves it when I trust Him and talk with Him. Our faith is precious (valuable) to Him, more than gold (1 Pet. 1:7). The centurion respected Jesus and knew that he wasn’t worthy for Jesus to come to his house. I understand that I also am not worthy of Jesus’s love, grace and forgiveness. But when I believe in Him, He says that I can come to Him at any time and at any hour with any need. Jesus helped the centurion (a non-Jew) and through this I understand that God always had a plan to save not only the Jews but all other people as well. He is pleased when we come to Him. __Jesus, I believe that You are strong, that You are God and that You love me and help me. I love You, Jesus, and thank You for Your love and care towards me.__
  Jesus also fulfills prophecy. Long ago, God promised to send Jesus. In the gospels, I see that God fulfilled His Word through Jesus. Jesus not only healed physical diseases, but He heals the worst disease of all: sin. He took my sin upon Himself and cleanses and forgives me when I believe in Him. I am saved by His grace, by faith in Jesus.  People were amazed and praised God when Jesus healed. I also am thankful and praise God that He heals. Just like Peter’s mother-in-law, I want to show Jesus my love and thankfulness. __Thank you Jesus!__
