Summary: |+
  God had brought the people back from captivity, as He promised.”When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing” (Ps.126:1-2).

  Haggai: The people returned to the land, had started to rebuild the temple and then stopped rebuilding. God told them through the prophet Haggai that He wasn’t blessing them because they hadn’t made Him their priority (1:4-5). The people listened to God and started to rebuild the temple and God blessed them (1:12-13). The prophet encouraged their leader, Zerubbabel, and the people to rebuild. He reminded them that God was with them. God said ““The final glory of this house  will be greater than the first,” says the Lord of Hosts. “I will provide peace in this place”—this is the declaration of the Lord of Hosts” (2:9). He promised to shake the Gentile kingdoms and make Zerubbabel His chosen one (2:23).

  Ezra: ch. 1: God fulfilled His Word that He spoke through the prophet Isaiah that a king named Cyrus would give a command that the Israelites in captivity could return to their land and restore their temple in Jerusalem. (see Is. 44:24-28 through Is. 45:1-7).

  2 Chron. 36:22-23: “ In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the word of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The Lord put it into the mind of King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and also to put it in writing: 23 This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build Him a temple at Jerusalem in Judah. Whoever among you of His people may go up, and may the Lord his God be with him.”

Application: |
  I know that when God promises, He fulfills His Word. I can read the Bible and know that His Word is true. Jesus helps me to fulfill God’s Word just as God helped the people to rebuild the temple when He told them too. Sometimes people are against God’s word but nothing can stop God. God helps me to fulfill His Word. I can praise God not only in church, but everywhere. I can sing to God and thank Him for His love which He shows me in Christ Jesus.

  In Haggai, God wrote a lot about Zerubbabel, the person who led the people back to the land of Israel from Babylon (Ezra 2:2). He is important because though him, God fulfilled His promise to David and to us to send a Messiah. Zerubbabel is in the genealogy of Jesus (see Matt. 1:12, Lk. 3:27). Although God’s people were in Babylon for 70 years, God kept the line of David alive and returned them to the land. Why is this important for me? I see that God always fulfills His Word and Him promises to me in the Bible. He is my Savior and King. He keeps me and can use my life, so that more people would know about the salvation and forgiveness that Jesus gives. I have become a part of God’s family through faith in Jesus. God also promises to shake heaven and earth and all the kingdoms. He will set up His eternal kingdom where Jesus will reign forever (2:6-9, 20-23).
  Psalm 126 speaks about the people’s joy in returning to Israel and says, “He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.” (Ps. 126:6). I can share with people that Jesus is Saviour to those who trust Him and that He is Judge to those who do not trust Him. This can be like planting seeds. It is not easy to tell people the truth and sometimes they don’t like what they hear. But after the seeds of truth are planted, God makes them grow and  there is a “harvest” of souls who know Jesus. Those who planted rejoice. In the same way, God causes His Word to bring life to people’s hearts when they believe in Jesus. There is a harvest of people gathered to Jesus. This is very joyful! Lord Jesus, use me to share with people that you are Saviour. You said: “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 __Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matt 9:37). You are coming soon, Lord Jesus, help me to love you with all my heart, soul and strength and to share your love and salvation with people.__
