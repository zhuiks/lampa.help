Summary: |
  In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas again shared in the synagogue and many Jews and Gentiles believed. The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles wanted to stone them but they left and went to Lycaonia. In the city of Lystra, Paul healed a crippled man in the name of Jesus. People thought that Paul and Barnabas were gods and wanted to sacrifice to them. But Paul explained that there is only one God who made heaven and earth and that they should worship Him. Then the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles stoned Paul. The believers prayed for him and he got up and continued on. In every place they prayed and fasted that God would show them who should be leaders there. They later returned to the church in Antioch, from which they were sent out.  “Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles” (14:27).

Application: |
  People often change their minds. I myself often change my opinion. We, people, are changeable. I am glad that God never changes! At the beginning of the story, people had wanted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods and then after a little while they were ready to kill them! I trust God and not people because we, people, don’t always act right and don’t always understand correctly. __Jesus, please give me patience and wisdom when people don’t understand what I am telling them about You. Help me to not be afraid to share about You, Jesus.__
  When Paul and Barnabas shared about Jesus, some people believed in Him and others didn’t. Some became a part of the church (a group of believers in Jesus) and others wanted to stop them and kick them out. There will always be different reactions (responses) towards Jesus. I know that Jesus wants to save everyone but not everyone will love Jesus. People who don’t love Jesus also won’t love me. It’s important that I know: Jesus loves me and loves them. That’s why I want to tell people about Him. People without Jesus will perish (die without hope) but God doesn’t want people to perish. __Jesus, help me to share about You. Give me boldness to share even when people don’t receive You. Thank you that You are always with me even when it’s scary and people want to kick me out because of my faith in You. Use my life, so that many people would know You, Jesus!__
