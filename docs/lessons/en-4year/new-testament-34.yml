Summary: |-
  Jesus was with His disciples and a crowd of people was following Him. They knew that He had done miracles and wanted to be with Him. He fed them miraculously, making an abundance of bread and fish from very little. All the people saw the miracle and believed that He was the Prophet that Moses had spoken of, for whom they were waiting. Then they wanted to make Jesus king, but He left. Jesus sent His disciples off in a boat and went to pray by Himself. Later, He came to them, walking on the water. Peter asked if he could come out to Him on the water and started to walk, but then was scared by the wind and started to sink, but Jesus saved HIm. All the disciples worshiped Jesus and said “truly You are the Son of God!” (v. 33)

Application: |
  Jesus knew people’s needs and He had a plan to help them. He knows my needs and can help me. For Jesus, nothing is impossible. Jesus provided for people’s physical needs. He also provided for their spiritual needs. Everyone needs to eat in order to live (bread in this story). But everyone also needs a relationship (friendship) with God in order to have real life. This is why Jesus said “I am the bread of Life.” I need to be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus in order to live. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and forgives my sins, He gives me new life with God.
  Jesus took a small amount of bread and fish and fed a huge crowd of people. It doesn’t matter what I have (a little or a lot). It’s important that I give whatever I have to Jesus so that He would be praised and do that which He wants to do with what I give Him. People followed Jesus because they saw His miracles and not because they believed that He is the Son of God. Why do I follow Jesus? Do I want to get something from Him or simply be with Him because I understand that He is Savior and King and the Most Important?
  __Jesus, help me to love You more. Thank you, Jesus that You are caring and loving. Thank you that You died for me and give me life in You when I trust You.__
  Peter trusted Jesus and started to walk to Him on the water but then he saw the waves, he got scared and started to sink. Jesus was nearby to save Peter when he cried out to Him. I believe that when I look to Jesus and follow Him, He gives me the opportunity to do that which is impossible to do without Him. If I don’t trust Jesus, I can’t do anything miraculous and will “sink” like Peter. But Jesus is my Savior and He lifts me up when I fall. __Jesus, help me to always trust You and look to You. You are my Life. You can do all things. Be praised through my life. You are worthy!__
