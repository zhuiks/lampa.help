Summary: |+
  Esther came to the king and he received her. She invited him and Haman to a banquet. Before the banquet, the king found out how Mordecai had saved his life earlier and commanded Haman to reward him. Later, at a second banquet, the king asked Esther how he could help her. She told him Haman’s plan to kill her people. The king was angry, killed Haman and helped the Jews to defend themselves against those who wanted to kill them. God saved his people and gave Mordecai all of Haman’s property.

Character:
- God is our Defence
- God is Savior
- God has all authority
- God is the Righteous Judge
Application: |
  Esther wasn’t sure what to expect when she approached the king. She took a step of faith and was ready with a plan of action (to invite the king to dinner). God gave her wisdom to know how to talk with the king about the threat against her people. When I seek God, He gives me wisdom for difficult situations and conversations. God used Esther and Mordecai to save many Jewish people throughout the kingdom. Even today, the Jews celebrate Purim to remember how God delivered them from their enemies.
  In the end, God will judge those who are against Him and His people. I can trust God and know that He is a Righteous Judge. My job is to love people and tell them about salvation in Jesus. God wants to save people.

  *fun facts: 1) the city of Susa is in modern day Iran 2) King Darius from Daniel ch. 6 is the father of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes or Artaxerxes) in Esther. 3) the name of God is not mentioned directly in the book of Esther but some see it in acrostic form in the original text. that is, God’s name is hidden in the text. Letters spelling YHWH are in certain verses(Esther 1:20, 5:4, 13, 7:7). Although His name is hidden, God is the Saviour and Defender in this story.
