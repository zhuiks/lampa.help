Summary: |-
  The Israelites were slaves in Egypt. Pharaoh gave an order to kill every Hebrew baby boy because the Egyptians were afraid that the Hebrew people would grow strong and turn against them. The Hebrew midwives refused to kill the babies. Moses’ parents hid him and later placed him in a basket, so that he would float down the river. Pharaoh’s daughter found him and decided to adopt him. She hired Moses’ own mother to take care of him for her.

  See also Hebrews 11:23 “By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s command.”
