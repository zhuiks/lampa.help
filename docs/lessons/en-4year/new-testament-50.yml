Application: |
  I believe that Jesus is God because only God can live a sinless life and rise from the dead. I believe that Jesus never sinned and completely fulfilled the Law. He also fulfilled all prophecies regarding His death and resurrection when He lived on earth. I can trust Jesus and know that He fulfills His Word. He is the Victor. He conquered sin and death and gives me the power of the Holy Spirit to not sin but to do that which is pleasing to God and live according to God’s Word. __Jesus, I trust You. Praise You for Your victory! Thank you for salvation, forgiveness and justification that I have in the knowledge of You! Help me to tell everyone about life in You!__

  see also Rom 6:5-11: “For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, 6 knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. 7 For he who has died has been freed from sin. 8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”
