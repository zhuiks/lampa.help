Summary: |
  God created Adam and Eve in His image. First, He created Adam: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.” v. 7. “And the Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”… the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name…But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him. 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 22 Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. 23 And Adam said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh…” 24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.“ (v.18-25).

Application: |
  God made Adam and Eve in His image. He made me in His image! What does this mean? It means that because God is the Creator, I like to create, because God is Spirit, I am spiritual, because God is the Communicator, I communicate, because God has a Reason and Feelings, I think and feel, because God is Relational, I have relationships.* People’s good characteristics can reflect God. Reason, creativity, emotions, skills, beauty, love and honesty are all from God and show us what our God is like.
  Adam and Eve were the first people and the first husband and wife. God gives unity to a husband and wife so that they can be together as a family.
  God is so good and gave me life (physical). It’s right that I would love Him most of all, worship Him and follow all that He says, obeying Him. He created us for fellowship with Him, which is spiritual life. Our sin separates us from fellowship with God. But through faith in Jesus, I can have fellowship with God again. This fellowship is called eternal life.  (Jn. 17:3 “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”). __Dear God, thank you that you gave me life! Help me to listen to you and love you. Please help me to show your love and goodness to others, that they would know how wonderful you are! Amen.__
  Note: This is a good opportunity to ask the children if they have eternal (spiritual) life through faith in Jesus and share the gospel with them. May God save the children that you teach and give them life in Jesus!
