Book: The Manifestation of Christ.
Scripture: Matt 2
Truth: God leads us
Verse: Matt. 2:2 ”we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him”
Summary: |-
  When Jesus was born, the wise men saw His star in heaven and understood that a King was born. They followed the star and came to King Herod in order to find out in which city the Messiah was supposed to be born. They read the words of prophecy, where it is written that He would be born in Bethlehem (see Micah 5:2). They found Jesus there, worshipped Him and gave Him treasures (gold, frankincense and myrrh).
  God warned the wise men to go home by another way. God also sent an angel to Joseph in a dream to tell him to get away to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill Jesus. They left in the night for Egypt. Herod gave an order to kill all the baby boys under 2 years old in Bethlehem because he didn’t want Jesus to be king. After Herod’s death, Joseph, Mary and Jesus returned and lived in Nazareth.

Application: |
  The wise men wanted to worship Jesus. They believed that He was King. God led them by the star so that they could worship Him. God led and warned the wise men and Joseph through dreams. They trusted God and followed Him. God leads me also.  He gave me the Bible that I can read to know what He says to me.
  I know that Jesus is King. The wise men gave Him their treasures. I also can give Jesus all that is dear to me (my love, attention, obedience) because I love Him. I want to worship Jesus and show that He is the most important. The wise men traveled a long time to see Jesus. They searched for Him. I don’t need to look for Jesus (physically). When I read the Bible, I can know Him. Also, I can pray and know that He hears me. He is near and He leads me when I seek to live God’s way.__ Jesus, help me and lead me. I worship You and trust You.__
