Book: '2 Peter: Exhortation to purification in Christ.'
Scripture: 2 Peter
Truth: The Day of the Lord is coming soon
Verse: 2 Pet. 1:3 “His divine power has given us everything required for life and
  godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness.”
Summary: |-
  2 Pet. 1: Grace and peace are multiplied in the knowledge of Jesus. God gives us everything needed for life and godliness in the knowledge of Him (1:3). He gave us great and precious promises (2 Pet.1:4). Peter knew that he would die soon but he wanted to write believers and remind them of this truth. He himself saw Jesus and all that he did (2 Pet. 1:16). Believers should believe the Word because it was given by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21).

  2 Pet. 2: Peter warned about false teachers. God will judge them, just as He judged fallen angels and ungodly people (2 Pet. 2:4-6). But, “ …the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment“ (2 Pet. 2:9). False teachers, “…promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them“ (2 Pet. 2:19).

  Peter wrote this letter to remind believers about the truth that Jesus is coming and then there will be a judgement day. There will be people who say that Jesus is not coming and that there will be no judgement. “The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance.10 But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief;  on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed“ (2 Pet. 3:9-10). This is why believers want to live in holiness. Everything on earth will burn and melt. “But based on His promise, we wait for the new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell.“ (2 Pet.3:13). Believers await the return of Jesus and want to be pure before Him in the world. Peter wanted believers to guard themselves from false teaching and said, “But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen“ (2 Pet.3:18).
