Summary: |-
  After the celebration, Jesus taught in the temple. The leaders brought a woman to Him, who according to the Law, should die for her sin. They wanted to test and accuse Jesus. They asked Jesus what they should do with the woman. He said, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.” (Jn. 8:7) One by one, they started to leave. Jesus turned to the woman, didn’t condemn her and said, “go and sin no more” (v. 11).
  Jesus taught in the temple and told the leaders, “…I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.” (v. 12)  People didn’t receive Jesus’ testimony of Himself. He said that He and the Father testify of Him. He told them that soon He would go away (that is, die, rise again and ascend to heaven). He said: 1) that He is from above, 2) that those who don’t believe in Him will die in their sins, 3) that He will judge, 4) that He speaks the Words of His Father (God), 5) that He will be lifted up, 6) that He does what is pleasing to God the Father. Then many believed in Him. “Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. 32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (Jn. 8:31-32).
  Those who didn’t believe argued with Jesus and said that they were free (not slaves) but Jesus said that they were slaves to sin and that only He, the Son of God would free them. They said that Abraham was their father and that they weren’t slaves. But Jesus said that they didn’t believe like Abraham believed and that Satan was their father. Jesus told them that they didn’t want to receive the Word of God from Him and this is why they were not of God (v. 47). They started to say mean things about Jesus. Jesus answered that those who keep His Word will not see death. They were indignant, asking if He thought He was greater than Abraham and all the prophets who died. He answered, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad” (v. 56). They asked how He could have seen Abraham. Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” (v 58)  See also  Ex. 3:14. They wanted to stone Him and He left the temple.

Application: |
  Certain people wanted to catch Jesus when they brought the woman to Him. But He caught them. That is, He showed them that no one is sinless and can condemn another. Jesus showed mercy to the woman. Only He is sinless and can judge rightly. I deserve punishment but through faith in Jesus, I am forgiven. Jesus gives me strength by the Holy Spirit to go and sin no more. I don’t want to judge people but want to tell them about the salvation and mercy which is only found in Jesus.
  I need light to see where I am going and to not fall. This is why I need Jesus, the Light of the Word who shows me the truth and shows me how to love God. Light also shows when something is dirty (a window for example). Jesus shows that I am sinful and He can cleanse me. I am thankful that He is my Light. I want to tell people about Him.
  I believe that Jesus is God. I believe His Words, that I read in the Bible. Jesus says that His Word frees me. He frees me from slavery to sin and gives me eternal life.
  Jesus is eternal. He always was in heaven, but He came down to earth and became a person. He lived a sinless life, died in my place on the cross, rose again and now He is in heaven again. When I read the stories in the Old Testament about Abraham, David, Daniel, I see that God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit were there. This is why Jesus said that He was there before Abraham. He was and is and will always be. Abraham “saw His day” means that Abraham was waiting for that Sacrifice that God prepared for sin (Gen. 22:8) and he knew that God could raise the dead (see Hebrews 11:17-18). Jesus is my sacrifice for sin. I want to tell people that Jesus can forgive their sin and give them eternal life today and forever, in the knowledge of Him.

  *idea for object lesson. Talk about or show how constant exposure to light will fade the color of fabric. Constant fellowship with Jesus changes us, so that we display  His beauty in our lives.
