Book: 'Revelation: The consummation of human history in Christ’s person.'
Scripture: Revelation 16-20
Truth: God is the Righteous Judge
Verse: Rev. 19:11 “Then I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. Its rider
  is called Faithful and True, and He judges and makes war in righteousness.”
Summary: |
  7 bowls of God’s wrath. A voice from the heavenly temple told the angels to pour out God’s wrath on the earth. The angels said that God is just and His judgement is righteous. People didn’t repent when God judged them (16:9 and 11). People on earth gathered at Armegeddon. When the angel poured out the 7th bowl on the earth, he said, “it is finished.” John said how God judged and conquered those who didn’t believe in Jesus. “They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful.“ (17:14). God brought an end to all the evil earthly kingdoms and judged them. “Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her (Babylon)!“ (18:20). In heaven, a great multitude of people said: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, 2  for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.“ (19:1-2). The people in heaven rejoiced that the time had come for the wedding feast of the Lamb.
  John saw how Jesus came on a white horse. He is King, He is Faithful and True. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. He is the Word of God. Jesus judged and conquered all His enemies (including the Beast and the false prophet). An angel locked up the dragon (Satan) for 1,000 years in a bottomless pit so that he would not deceive people. Jesus reigned on earth for 1,000 years with the saints whom He resurrected. At the end of the 1,000 years, Satan was freed and deceived the nations. The nations warred against Jesus and wanted to win, but God saved His own and Satan was thrown into the lake of fire. John saw the Great White Throne and all the dead stood to be judged before God. If their name was not in the Lamb’s book of life, the person was thrown into the lake of fire. Death and hell were also thrown into the lake of fire.

  I believe that earthly kingdoms will come to an end, but the Heavenly Kingdom is eternal. I understand that God judges those who don’t believe in Jesus and they will be eternally punished. Jesus is coming and will conquer! Believers will rule with Him in His Kingdom. Now, it seems like Satan and evil people are winning but the Bible teaches me that they will lose. __Thank you Jesus that you have the victory! Thank you that my name is written in Your book of life because You have redeemed me and I belong to You. I want to be Your witness, so that people would know that You are King of kings and Lord of lords. Thank you for the living hope that I will be with You in Your glory forever. Help me to live in expectation of your return and tell people about salvation in You. __
