Summary: |
  God told the people not to take anything from Jericho but one man didn’t listen and hid some treasure in his tent. Then when the people went to fight against another city, Ai, they didn’t win. Joshua sought the Lord and God told him that they were struck because of sin. The people found the man who sinned and punished him. Then the people fought against Ai and that time, God allowed them to take treasures.
  Ch. 9 The people of Gibeon tricked the Israelites. They were afraid that Israel would destroy them and so they tricked them into making a peace treaty with them. The Israelites didn’t ask God for advice before they made the treaty. God wanted to protect the people from being bound to people who didn’t love God. Now God wanted the people to keep their word and not break their promise, but fight and defend the people of Gibeon.
  The people fought against 5 kings; Joshua asked God to stop the sun in the sky during the battle. God did it and the people won. The people continued to fight against many cities. God gave them victory, just as He promised.

Application: |
  It’s very important for me to listen to God. Sometimes I want something and God tells me not to take it, just like He forbid the people to take the treasures from Jericho. He knows what is good for me and what is harmful for me. If God tells me not to do something, I am confident that He has something better for me later.
  I need to ask God to give me wisdom to make decisions according to His will and not rush, like the people did when they made a treaty with unbelievers. I know that He will answer me when I seek to know His opinion. I can read the Bible and know what God wants and how to live. God can help me to keep my promises and act how Jesus wants me to act.
  God promised to give the people the land and He even stopped the sun, to give them success! For God, nothing is impossible. I trust Jesus.

  *there are various legends in different cultures around the world that talk about a long day or a long night. They have these legends because of the day that God stopped the sun. Here is one link which discusses this topic: http://s8int.com/page35.html
