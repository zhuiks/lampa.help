Summary: |+
  Hosea: God wanted to show Israel that they were acting like an unfaithful wife. He used Hosea’s life to explain this. He told Hosea to marry Gomer, who was a prostitute (she sold her body in sin to other people). She had children and later left Hosea. But Hosea sought Gomer. She had become a slave and Hosea redeemed her. He was a faithful husband to her.
  Hos. 3:5 “Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.”
  Hos. 6:1-3 “Come, let us return to the Lord. For He has torn us, and He will heal us; He has wounded us, and He will bind up our wounds. 2 He will revive us after two days, and on the third day He will raise us up so we can live in His presence. 3 Let us strive to know the Lord. His appearance is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land.”
  Isaiah 54: God said that He is like a husband to His people. His people acted like an unfaithful wife but God showed them his mercy and love. He disciplined the people and sent them into captivity to a different land but promised to return them to their land. “Though the mountains move and the hills shake, My love will not be removed from you and My covenant of peace will not be shaken,” says your compassionate Lord” (54:10).

  Nahum: The prophet Nahum lived during the reign of king Josiah in Judah (the southern kingdom). The Assyrians had already led the northern kingdom of Israel away into captivity. God said that he would punish Nineveh, the capitol of the Assyrian empire for their cruel treatment of God’s people. God said that He would judge the sinful city. Nahum prophesied that water and fire would destroy the city: 2:6 “The river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away” (2:6). “Nineveh has been like a pool of water from her first days, but they are fleeing. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back” (2:8). “The fire will devour you there…” (3:15). “…the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour the bars of your gates” (3:13)
  God also wanted to comfort the people who suffered at the hands of the Assyrians. He said:
  1:15 “Look to the mountains— the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out” (1:15).  “For the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes, the majesty of Israel…” (2:2).

Application: |
  God loves me very much. He is always with me and promises to be with me forever. When I sin and love something or someone more than God, I am cheating on God (being unfaithful to Him).Hosea’s life and his attitude towards Gomer showed people that God is faithful to Israel even though they worshiped idols and didn’t love God. They became slaves to sin but God redeemed them. I can ask Jesus to forgive me and He helps me to love Him more than anyone or anything. When I live my own way, I become a slave to sin. Jesus came to earth and lived a sinless life, died on the cross and on the 3rd day rose again. He paid for my sin with His blood and frees me from the power of sin when I trust Him. He is my Redeemer, (like the example of Hosea and his wife Gomer). Jesus is faithful and I belong to Him. Jesus, help me to love you and follow after you all of my days. I love you.
  In the book of Nahum, God comforts Israel at a time when Assyria was cruel to them. Israel was suffering for the consequences of their sin, but God still wanted to express His love towards them. He gave them hope in HIm during a difficult time. Maybe I have done something wrong and am suffering the consequences for my sin. God still loves me and even His discipline shows me that He loves me. He wants me to draw close to Him and to trust Him. He is my help and He cares for me when I take refuge in HIm.
  Earlier, God spoke to the city of Nineveh through the prophet Jonah. At that time, Nineveh repented and God saved them from judgement. But in time, they again started to do evil and God later punished them. God fulfilled His Word in Nahum when the Babylonian Empire came,  captured Nineveh and destroyed the city with water and fire. I can know that God keeps and fulfills His Word. Everything that I read in the Bible is true. I can trust the Bible. Also, I should take the Bible seriously. God hates sin. I also should hate sin and ask Jesus for help to stop doing what is not pleasing to God. Jesus knows those who trust in Him (Nahum 1:7). When people sin against me, He helps me and comforts me. He gives me strength to love my enemies and gives me  hope, knowing that my suffering is temporary. I have a good future when I trust Jesus. He will avenge the evil people in the end because He is the Righteous Judge.

  About the prophets:
  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.
