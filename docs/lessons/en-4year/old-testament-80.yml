Summary: |+
  2 Kings 18:20: Hezekiah reigned in the southern kingdom (Judah) and trusted God. During his reign, Assyria took the northern kingdom (Israel) into captivity because of their disobedience. Hezekiah also feared the threat of the king of Assyria and prayed to God. God told him through the prophet Isaiah that He would save them from the enemy. God send an angel who killed many soldiers in the enemy’s army and they left. Hezekiah later got sick and God said that he would die. But when Hezekiah prayed to God, He decided to give him another 15 years to live. When people from Babylon came to visit Hezekiah, he proudly showed them all of his treasures. God told Hezekiah through Isaiah that later, the Babylonians would take all his treasures for themselves. Hezekiah didn’t take God’s words seriously. After a few more generations, God sent Babylon to take the southern kingdom away to captivity.
  2 Chron Ch. 29-32: Hezekiah helped people to turn back to God and start worshiping God rightly. 30:20, 26 and 31:20-21.
  “Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the Lord’s temple in Jerusalem to observe the Passover of Yahweh, the God of Israel.” (2 Chron.30:1). “So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the hand of the king and his officials, and according to the king’s command, saying, “Israelites, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped from the grasp of the kings of Assyria. 7 Don’t be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors so that He made them an object of horror as you yourselves see. 8 Don’t become obstinate now like your fathers did. Give your allegiance to Yahweh, and come to His sanctuary that He has consecrated forever. Serve the Lord your God so that He may turn His burning anger away from you, 9 for when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.” 10 The couriers traveled from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but the inhabitants laughed at them and mocked them. 11 But some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 12 Also, the power of God was at work in Judah to unite them  to carry out the command of the king and his officials by the word of the Lord.” (2 Chron. 30:6-12).
  1 Chron.32:25 because of pride, wrath was upon the southern kingdom. God tested the heart of the king (32:31).
  According to Jer. 26:18, Micah spoke these words against the corrupt leaders during Hezekiah’s reign: “Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the hill of the temple mount will be a thicket. “ (3:12).
  Isaiah 15-39: God gave Isaiah these worlds when Hezekiah was king. He spoke of the judgement of the nations that didn’t believe in God. He warned people to not trust Assyria. He said that the great Babylonian empire would one day fall.
  Ch. 24: a description the end of the world and God’s wrath upon the earth.
  Ch. 25: Those who trust God will live on a new earth

  Ch. 27-29: God punished the disobedient people. God warns them to not trust Egypt, who can’t save them. (ch. 30-31)
  Only God can help.
  Ch. 32-38: God calls people to trust Him and not their own strength. God blesses those who trust Him and punishes those who don’t.

Application: |
  When I look at the life of Hezekiah, I see that it’s important to trust God and remember that He is the most important. When Hezekiah was humble before God, everything was ok in his kingdom. Even when enemies came, God miraculously saved them. When I seek God (read his Word, pray to Him and desire His help daily) He blesses me with peace and joy in my heart even if my circumstances aren’t peaceful around me. I know that He is with me and that He hears my prayers.
  Hezekiah was proud of his riches and boasted before people. He didn’t understand that every blessing comes from God. When I am successful, I should remember that success comes from God and I should thank Him. God, help me to always trust You and not trust in my own strength or wisdom. Also, help me to be obedient to Your Word and listen to those who want to warn me if I start to walk away from You. Give me a humble heart. A humble heart is a happy heart. __Jesus, help me to be thankful for all that You give  and have a humble heart before You and others always.__
