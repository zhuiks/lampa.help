Title: Sacrifices
Book: 'Leviticus: The Sanctification of the Nation'
Scripture: Leviticus 1-7
Truth: Jesus blood cleanses us
Verse: Lev. 17:11 “For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have appointed
  it to you to make atonement on the altar for  your lives, since it is the lifeblood
  that makes atonement” or 1 Pet. 3:18 “For Christ also suffered for sins once for
  all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being
  put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm”
Summary: |-
  God gave people instructions about 5 different sacrifices. When the people of Israel sinned with their words or actions, God wanted them to bring different sacrifices to the tabernacle. When they did something their way instead of God’s way, the blood of the sacrifice would cover their sin. They also brought sacrifices as gifts to God (Lev. 1:10).

  see also: Heb. 7:27 “He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do—first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all when He offered Himself.”
  Heb.  9:12 “He entered the most holy place once for all, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.”
  Heb  10:10 “By this will of God, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.”
  1 Pet. 3:18 “For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm”
Character:
- God is holy
- God makes His will known
- God requires an accounting for our behavior (intentional and unintentional sin)
- Jesus’ blood pays for all our sin
- Jesus is the perfect once for all sacrifice for sin
- He is righteous
Application: |
  God wanted His people to be holy, that is, separate from others. They were called to live differently than the other people on earth. They were called to love God. Their lifestyle was suppose to show others the love of God. Sin (when we don’t love God) leads to death. The blood of an animal was poured out in place of the blood of the sinner. When they saw the blood of the animal, they remembered that their sin leads to death and that they needed forgiveness from God for their sin.
  Only Jesus can cleanse me and make me holy (sanctified, pure, clean). Only Jesus can help me to love God and live pleasing to Him. God wants me to love Him and His ways so that I would live different from the world (so my lifestyle wouldn’t be worldly) and for God (be like Jesus). Praise God that Jesus became the sacrifice for all my sins and I don’t need to bring different sacrifices and keep different rules for God to receive me. God received the sacrifice of Jesus because Jesus is fully God and fully  human. Only Jesus is sinless. Jesus, I trust You and Your righteousness. Cleanse my heart and give me love for God and others. Help me to live for You. You are Worthy. Receive my “sacrifice” of dying to my selfish desires. I want to live for your loving purposes (Rom 12:1-2, “Therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.”  2 Cor. 5:17 “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things  have come.”).
  *Jesus is the One who fulfilled every sacrifice for us, but it’s interesting that the fellowship offering was a sacrifice for fellowship with God. When Jesus ate with His disciples before His crucifixion and gave the disciples the bread and wine as a symbol of His body (communion), He showed that He is the only sacrifice for our sin and guilt but also that He gives us fellowship with God.
