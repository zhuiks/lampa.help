Summary: |-
  Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. He was there for 40 days and didn’t eat. Then the devil tempted Jesus and wanted Him to prove that He is God’s Son by turning rocks into bread. Jesus answered with the Word “it is written, man will not live on bread alone but by every word of God.” Then the devil wanted Jesus to throw Himself down from a high place. Jesus again answered with the Word “it is written, do not put the Lord your God to the test.” Then the devil showed Jesus all the powers of the earth and offered to give them to Him if He would worship Him. Jesus said “get away from me Satan, because it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God alone and serve Him alone.” Then the devil left Him and angels ministered to Jesus.

Application: |
  Jesus was tempted and never sinned. He is God. The devil tempted Jesus to 1) use His miraculous power for His own pleasure 2) wrongly apply a promise from the Bible and 3) worship the devil instead of God. Jesus responded to the devil’s temptation with the Word. It’s important for me to know God’s truth in the Bible. When I know God’s truth and ask Jesus for help, I can resist temptation. Jesus will help me to do the right thing. Jesus is my example and my help. 1 Cor. 10:13 says, “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear __it.”__
