Summary: |
  Ch. 11-12: The people complained against God and wanted meat. Moses talked with God and asked for help in leading and guiding the people.. God gave His Holy Spirit to 70 elders to help lead the people. Then God sent them pheasants but they didn’t thank God and He disciplined them. Many people died and were buried there. Moses’ brother and sister said bad things about him and envied him because God made him a leader. God was angry with them (12:9).
  Ch. 13-14: 12 spies, one from each tribe, went to survey the promised land for 40 days. They saw that it was VERY good. God promised to lead them into the land but 10 of the spies were afraid and gave the people a bad report. The people refused to follow where God was leading them to go. Only Joshua and Caleb told the people to trust God and to go into the land. God said that now the people had to stay in the desert for 40 years and all the people who didn’t trust God would die before the rest of the people could go into the promised land. Some people decided to go into the land on their own without God’s help but they were attacked by the people of the land.
  (see also Heb 3:7-4:1-10)
  Ch. 15-19: God gave instructions about sacrifices. One man broke God’s law and was punished. God told the people to add tassels to their clothing in order to remember God’s law. Korah, a Levite, and other people envied the ministry of Aaron and his sons and rebelled. 250 people brought fire pans with incense  before the Lord, but God’s fire killed them. Also, God made the earth swallow up Korah and those who rebelled (16:31-34). They used the metal from the  firepans to cover the altar (16:38). God demonstrated that He chose the sons of Aaron for the priesthood. One man from each tribe brought a staff and placed it in the tabernacle. “The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, formed buds, blossomed, and produced almonds!” (17:8). God explained that the sons of Aaron (who were also Levites) ministered in the tabernacle and the other sons of Levi only served around the tabernacle. (see 18:1-3). God said that all the Levites could eat a part of the sacrifices. God gave them special instructions for cleansing (ch.19).

Application: |
  The Bible says in Num. 11:4 that the people were craving meat. God knew that their hearts were not trusting Him. I can ask Him for help and trust Him that He will give me what I need. It’s wrong to be greedy and demand things from God because God controls everything and He lovingly cares for me. I need to ask for forgiveness when I want things to be my way and I am disrespectful towards God and others.__ Jesus, please forgive my sin and change my heart. You know my needs.__

  God wanted to lead the people into a good land where they could have rest. But the people didn’t trust God. Jesus wants to give me a special kind of rest for my heart. I can trust Him. When I am afraid of people or of some new place, I can know that God is with me. If God is leading me to go there, He will help me there. When I don’t listen to God, I miss an opportunity to be with Him, to be happy.  __Jesus, help me to trust you so I won’t miss the good things that You have planned for me. __

  In parts of these chapters, people envied the leaders or the ministry of others. God is wise in what ministry He gives to me and others. I can trust God and joyfully do what He has for me to do. Moses was humble and responded in humility. If I’m a leader and people are speaking bad things about me, I can trust God and not defend myself or get angry at them. If I am not happy with a leader, I can ask God for help and trust Him. Jesus is the greatest example of humility and He helps me to follow His example.
