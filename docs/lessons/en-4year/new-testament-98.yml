Summary: |-
  John saw heaven and the throne of God. Everything glorifies God. Only Jesus is worthy to open the scroll with 7 seals because He overcame. He is the Lamb of God. In heaven, people from every tribe, language, people and nation will worship and praise God. Jesus made believers king and priests of God: they will reign on earth (5:10).

  The 7 seals: In chapter 6, Jesus began to open the seals one by one and with each one, plagues happened on earth. John saw 144,000 sons of Israel that were sealed and many people from every tribe, language, people and nation. He saw those who died for their faith in Jesus who were in His presence and, “… the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them;He will guide them to springs of living waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.“ (7:17). When Jesus opened the 7th seal, there was 30 minutes of silence in heaven.

  The 7 trumpets: The angels blew the trumpets and plagues started to happen on earth. Many people died from sores and those who didn’t still refused to repent from their sin (9:20). In Ch. 10, John saw a strong angel with an open book which God told John to eat in order to further prophesy to people. God said that His 2 witnesses would prophesy for 3 ½ years until the Beast kills them. But after 3 ½ days they will be resurrected and go up into heaven.
  When the angel blows the 7th trumpet, “… there were loud voices in heaven saying: The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Messiah, and He will reign forever and ever!“ (11:15). People around the throne of God said, “The nations were angry, but Your wrath has come. The time has come for the dead to be judged and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth.“ (11:18).
  John saw a vision of a woman and a dragon and a war in heaven that showed how satan warred against God and believers in Jesus and could not prevail. The Dragon (Satan) gave authority to the Beast whom non-believers worshiped. He ruled for 3 ½ years and killed believers in Jesus (13:7). “If anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed with a sword, with a sword he will be killed. This demands the perseverance and faith of the saints.“ (13:10). Another beast appeared who deceived people with miracles and told people to worship the first beast. He put a mark on people so that only those with the mark could buy and sell.

  Ch. 14: John saw the Lamb (Jesus) on Mount Zion with the 144,000 sons of Israel. Then he saw, “…another angel flying high overhead, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. 7 He spoke with a loud voice: “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.“ (14:6-7). Another angel declared God’s victory and His punishment of non-believers. “This demands the perseverance of the saints, who keep God’s commands and their faith in Jesus.” 13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: The dead who die in the Lord from now on are blessed.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “let them rest from their labors, for their works follow them!“ (14:12-13).
  Then he saw how the angels in heaven began to harvest the earth with a sickle and throw grapes into the great winepress of God’s wrath. Those who overcame the beast sang to Jesus, “Great and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the Nations.4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, for all the nations will come and worship before You because Your righteous acts have been revealed.” (15:3-4).

Application: |
  Jesus is worthy of worship. I worship Him alone. My prayers are like a pleasing fragrance before God (5:8). I believe that Jesus rules over all. Now I see those who don’t love Jesus and are doing evil. The Bible teaches me that Jesus will punish sin and destroy those who rebel on this fallen world. He wants me to trust Him and worship Him alone. Only He is worthy because He conquered sin and death on the cross and shed His blood to redeem me. Believers die for their faith in Jesus but a great reward awaits those who endure and remain faithful to Him. Jesus is always with me and He is my help.
  Now there is time for non-believers to repent and come to Jesus. I don’t want unbelievers to experience the wrath of God. Believers receive salvation and not wrath as it says, “For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, “ (1 Thess. 5:9). __Jesus, help me to trust You, follow You and tell people about salvation in You. You are the Great Savior. You conquered. Thank you that you redeemed me and I belong to You and will be with You in Your eternal kingdom. All honor and glory to You forever.__
