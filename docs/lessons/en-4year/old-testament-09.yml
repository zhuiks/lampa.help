Summary: |+
  The evil people where Lot lived fought and took Lot and his family captive. Abram heard about this and went out to save him. He saved him and then a priest-king named Melchizedek blessed Abram. After this God said “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward” (15:1). Abram wanted a child and God promised to give him more descendants than the stars in heaven. “And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness” (Gen. 15:6). God made a covenant with Abram. He also promised to give Abram the land where he was and said that his descendants would be in slavery there for 400 years and afterwards God would lead them out of slavery to the promised land (15:13-16).

Application: |
  Lot chose to live among people that didn’t love God. He ended up in a scary situation when they started to fight. I should be careful about who I spend time with. If I’m spending time with people who don’t love God, they could do some things that God doesn’t like and it could be dangerous for me.
  Abram went to save Lot from his enemies. Jesus came to save me from sin. The priest-king named Melchizedek who blessed Abram reminds us of Jesus. Jesus is our High Priest and our King. He blesses those who love God. Melchizedek gave Abram bread and wine, which is like communion. Communion is when we remember what Jesus did for us on the cross, when He gave His body (bread symbolized His body) and shed His blood (wine symbolizes His blood). See Heb.7 to read more about Jesus and Melchizedek.
  God promised to give Abram children and land. He believed God and God accounted it to him as righteousness. This shows me that I am not saved by good deeds but by faith in Jesus (see Rom. 4:3 and Gal. 3:6). I believe in Jesus and all that is written in the Bible.
