Summary: |-
  Jesus and His disciples were at a wedding in Cana. Mary was also there. During the celebration, the wine ran out. Mary told the servants to do what Jesus said. He told them to fill 6 large jars with water. Then He told them to draw out the water and give it to the master of the feast to drink. The master of the feast tried it and told the groom that usually people give the good tasting wine first and then the lesser wine later but he gave them the best wine at the end. This was Jesus’ first miracle and He showed His glory. His disciples believed in Him.

Application: |
  Mary knew about the problem at the wedding and she knew that Jesus could help the people. She told people to do what Jesus said. When I see that people have a problem, I too can tell them about Jesus and tell them to listen to Him. By myself, I can’t help people in a miraculous way but Jesus can! Jesus turned water into wine. He took that which was ordinary and made it special. Jesus does the miracle of  changing the hearts and lives of those who believe in Him. __ Jesus, by your grace, change my heart and my life and use me to point many people to You, the One who transforms us into children of God through faith in You! __
