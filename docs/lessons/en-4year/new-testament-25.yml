Summary: |
  “Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. 24 And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. 25 Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” 26 But He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?” (Matt. 8:23-27)
  When the got to the other side of the shore, they saw a demon-possessed man. The demons were afraid of Jesus and asked Him to drive them into a herd of pigs. Jesus healed the man and drove the demons into the pigs, which then ran into the sea and drowned. The people of the region were scared and asked Jesus to leave their area. The healed man wanted to go with Jesus. “However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.” 20 And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled.” (Mark 5:19-20)

Application: |
  When I am scared, I can call to Jesus and He will help me. Jesus is always with me and wants to help. He created everything and that’s why He has authority over everything. Everything submits to Jesus. When Jesus was on the earth, He slept (because He is 100% God and 100% human) but He was always ready to help at any moment. Now, Jesus is in heaven and never sleeps. He is even so close to those who believe in Him that you can say that He lives right in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). Do I believe in Jesus? When I am afraid, do I understand that Jesus is my help and that nothing and no one is higher than Him. If He says something, then it will be. When there our waves of worry in my heart, He can bring peace and calm. He is kind and loving towards me.
  Have I ever been in a scary situation? I know that when I’m scared, Jesus is with me. He has everything under control and He can help. All of creation is under Jesus authority. Demons, who are fallen angels, obey Jesus and await the day when He will punish them eternally. Jesus is God. He is above everything and everyone. Just as Jesus calmed the sea and healed the demon-possessed man, He can give me peace and calm. He can free people from fear, from slavery to sin or from demons. I can tell people that Jesus has authority over everything.
