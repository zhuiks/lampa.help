Summary: |-
  John, the son of Zacharias began to preach a baptism of repentance and forgiveness of sins. The prophet Isaiah had said long ago that God would send John to prepare the way for people to come to Jesus for salvation. Many people came to John by the Jordan river. John told them that they should repent and start living in the way that pleased God. He also said that Jesus would come soon and would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire, and not with water. He also said that Jesus would judge people (Lk. 3:17). Jesus came to John to be baptized. The Holy Spirit came down upon Jesus in the form of a dove and God the Father said “You are my Beloved on, I am very pleased with You.” Jesus was about 30 when He began His ministry (Lk. 3:23). He is the Son of God.

Application: |
  John the Baptist spoke the Word of God to people and called them to repent and told them about forgiveness from God. He told people about Jesus. Repent means to turn away from living my way and turn towards Jesus, so He can help me to live His way. When I repent and trust Jesus, He saves me and gives me His Holy Spirit. God the Holy Spirit lives in every believer and gives them strength to live God’s way. He gives believers God’s love, strength and wisdom. Like John the Baptist, I too can share the truth about Jesus and tell people that they need to repent, trust Jesus  and receive forgiveness from Him. I can warn people that Jesus will judge and punish those that don’t repent, believe and follow Him.  __Jesus, thank you for forgiving  my sins and saving me from your punishment!__
  Jesus came to be baptized in order to show that He was given to (sanctified) God and His plan of salvation. When He went under the water, it was showing how He was going to take our sin and die for us on the cross. When He came up from the water, it was showing how He would rise from the dead. Jesus is God. God the Father loves the Son.
  In this passage, I see the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). They are One. Every characteristic that God the Father has, God the Son and God the Spirit have also. God the Father is loving. God the Son is loving. God the Spirit is loving. God is a God of fellowship. He chose to manifest Himself to us in the Trinity, so that we would understand that He created us for fellowship with Himself and one another.
