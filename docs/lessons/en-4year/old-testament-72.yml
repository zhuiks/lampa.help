Summary: |+
  Ch. 17: King Jehoshaphat walked with God and removed false worship from the land. He send teachers and priests throughout the land to teach people God’s Word. God was with Jehoshaphat. He had riches and power.
  Ch. 18:King Jehoshaphat’s son married King Ahab’s daughter (2 Kings 8:18, 2 Chron 21:6). Jehoshaphat wanted to hear from God’s prophet when they prepared to fight the enemy together (see 1 Kings 22).
  Ch. 19: God told Jehoshaphat that He was angry that he had joined with Ahab in war because Ahab did not love God, but God was pleased that Jehoshaphat wanted to seek Him. The king again went through the country to set up godly judges and priests and bring people close to the Lord.
  Ch. 20: When the enemy came against his land, “Jehoshaphat was afraid, and he resolved to seek the Lord. Then he proclaimed a fast for all Judah, 4 who gathered to seek the Lord. They even came from all the cities of Judah to seek Him.” They gathered in the temple court and the king prayed and asked God to help them. They bowed to the ground and praised the Lord in song (v.18-19). In the morning, they went out to battle and were singing praises, “Give thanks to the Lord, for His faithful love endures forever” (v. 21.). The Lord made their enemies fight against one another and they destroyed each other. Judah’s army gathered plunder from their defeated enemies for 3 days. They rejoiced that God gave them victory,  “So they came into Jerusalem to the Lord’s temple with harps, lyres, and trumpets” (v. 28). God gave them peace in the land.
  Jehoshaphat made an alliance with Ahab’s son Amaziah to made ships. But God told him through a prophet that it was wrong to be united with Amaziah, who didn’t love God and that the ships would be broken up. It happened just as God said.

Application: |
  Jehoshaphat was one of Judah’s good and godly leaders. He led the people well and taught them to know God’s Word and walk in God’s ways. Because of this, there was peace in the land and God gave them miraculous victory over their enemies. The people praised God with music and the Lord defeated their enemies. When I praise God in song, I can think about the words and what I am saying about God. I can express my love and trust to God through music. He is worthy to be praised!
  Twice, Jehoshaphat made alliances with kings in Israel that didn’t love God. Those kings did many wicked things and God did not want Jehoshaphat to join with them. Jesus, help me to be wise about with whom I join. God was faithful to tell Jehoshaphat when he had done something wrong.  __Lord Jesus, please help me to listen and follow You when you correct me. You are a great Savior and You are worthy of praise!__
