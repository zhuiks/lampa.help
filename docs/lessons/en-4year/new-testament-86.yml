Summary: |
  Paul wrote a letter to the church while he was in prison (Eph 3:1, 4:1, 6:20). Most of the believers in the Ephesian church were Gentiles. (2:11-22).
  Jesus is the head of believers and they make up a body where each one does their part and grow in love (4:15-16)
  Believers love and respect one another: Believers should follow the example of Jesus. The Holy Spirit changes them (4:20-24). “And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.”(4:32). In all their relationships, believers should love and respect one another: husbands and wives, children and parents, workers and bosses. (5:21-6:9)
  Jesus helps believers to stand in truth (and against the devil): Believers should, “be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” (6:10) Jesus gives believers all that they need to stand safe in the truth (6:10-20). Jesus gave believers protection (the armor of God). This protection is: truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation and the Word of God. All these help the believer to stand in the truth of their: 1)spiritual blessings 2)their salvation by grace 3) their unity with other believers in Christ 4) their love and respect for others.
  Jesus gives us all that we need to stand against the devil. Believers pray in the Spirit for one another that God would help them to boldly share the Good News of Jesus (6:18-20).

Application: |
  __Jesus, I trust You. You are my truth, my righteousness, my good news and the One whom I believe in for my salvation and You are the Word of God. I myself am weak but You are my strength and help. When it’s hard for me to love others or stand against sin, help me to turn to You for help. Remind me of the truth of the Bible, how You completed (“it is finished”) my salvation and forgiveness. You saved me by grace and gave me new life in You. You gave me the Holy Spirit so I can live pleasing to You and share with people about You. Thank you Jesus.__

  The picture of the armor of God shows me Jesus and my new life in Him.

  The belt of truth: Jesus and His ways are right. When I know Jesus and what pleases Him then that truth acts like a belt that helps my clothes to stay on right. When I know the truth, I won’t listen to the lies of the devil. What truth do I know from the Bible? (example: Jesus is the Only Saviour and I have spiritual blessings in Jesus Eph 1:3)

  The breastplate of righteousness: Jesus is my righteousness. I am saved by grace and not by works (Eph 2:8). Knowing that Jesus is my righteousness works like a breastplate that protects my heart from wrong thoughts and pride. I remember that Jesus gave me salvation as a gift.

  Feet ready wearing the gospel of peace: Salvation and forgiveness in Jesus is good news! Jesus is the Saviour of all who believe and He gives us unity and peace in Him! (2:17-22). I put on shoes to go somewhere more easily or faster. I want to know the good news about Jesus so I can be ready to share about Jesus and His love and salvation for all!

  The shield of faith: I believe that Jesus saved me and now I am a child of God. When I’m having a hard time, I can boldly and with faith ask Jesus to help me and He will protect me like a shield and give me strength from the Holy Spirit to trust Him and know His love (3:12, 16-19).

  The helmet of salvation: Jesus changes my thinking and my life. I love Jesus and want to live pleasing to Him. He helps me to put off the old way of life and start to live a new life in Christ. Just like a helmet protects the head, so salvation in Jesus protects my mind and His Spirit renews my thinking and my life (4:23-24).

  The sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God: Jesus gave us the Bible, that is, the Word of God. When I believe what is written in the Word, then it works like a sword that protects from falsehood and helps me destroy sin in my life (4:30-32).

  Prayer: __Jesus, please  help me to imitate You and as God’s beloved child to live in love as You loved us and gave Yourself for us (5:1-2). Please fill me with the Holy Spirit, to love and respect other believers (5:18-21). Please help me to stand in God’s power against the devil (6:10). Jesus,  help me and other believers to boldly share about Your salvation and love! (6:18-20).__
