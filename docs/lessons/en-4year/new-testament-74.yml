Title:  The gifts of the Holy Spirit and the resurrection of believers
Book: '1 Corinthians: Sanctification in Christ (1:2)'
Scripture: 1 Cor. 9-16
Truth: Jesus gives the Holy Spirit and new life
Verse: 1 Cor. 13:1-18 “Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have
  not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 2 And though I have
  the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though
  I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
  3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to
  be burned,[a] but have not love, it profits me nothing. 4 Love suffers long and
  is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does
  not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does
  not rejoice in iniquity, but  rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes
  all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 8 Love never fails. But whether
  there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease;
  whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.”
Summary: |-
  Paul wanted to share the gospel with everyone and that’s why he made himself a servant (slave), so that more people would be saved (9:19). He gave an example of a person who is running a marathon for a prize. Believers live with their eyes on the heavenly destination, thinking about Jesus, who is our prize. (9:24-27) Believers shouldn’t worship idols but run from idol worship. Jesus helps us to run from temptation (10:13) “Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.“ (10:31) Paul wrote that Jesus is the head and everyone submits to Him. He wrote about the Lord’s Supper and how it should be done in remembrance of Jesus. (11:25)
  The Holy Spirit gives different gifts to believers. Just as there are different parts of the body the different gifts amongst believers help the body to care for itself. (12:25-26) Believers are to use all the gifts with love. (13:4-13) God wants the gifts of the Spirit to be used in an orderly manner during a service so that people are edified. (ch 14)
  Paul wanted believers to stand in the truth about Jesus, “ that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.“ (15:4) Certain people in Corinth didn’t believe that there would be a resurrection from the dead and Paul corrected them. “ For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. 23 But each one in his own order: Christ the first fruits, afterward those who are Christ’s at His coming. 24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. 25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. 26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is death“ (15:22-26). Believers will receive a new immortal body when Jesus returns! “So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”[55 “O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?” 56 The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.“ (15:54-58)
  “Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. 14 Let all that you do be done with love “ (16:13-14)

Application: |
  The Corinthian believers acted in pride sometimes and that’s why Paul wrote them a lot about how to love one another during their services, when they ate together etc. Everything that I do is founded upon what Jesus did for me and I want to do everything for Jesus’ glory (10:31). I want to do everything with love. (16:14) God gives the gifts of the Holy Spirit. He wants me to use these gifts with love. What gifts does the Holy Spirit give? Why does He give us the gifts? What should I do with the gifts? __Jesus, show me how I can build up believers with the gifts that You have given me. Give me a humble heart that loves You and others.__
   I believe that Jesus is coming and that He will receive me and give me a new immortal body. Jesu is my hope. I want to tell people about how Jesus conquered death and hell. I want to tell them how through faith in Him, they can have forgiveness from God and new life, eternal life, now and forever.
