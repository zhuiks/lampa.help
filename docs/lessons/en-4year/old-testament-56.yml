  I understand that God’s Word is unique and living (Heb. 4:12). God speaks to me personally through His Word. I pray that God would give me a love for the Word, a desire to read it and help me to understand it and live by it. __Jesus, thank you that I can know You and Your will through the Word. God, help me to know, love and share Your Word. Help me to hide Your Word in my heart. Jesus, show me which verses I should memorize by heart.__
