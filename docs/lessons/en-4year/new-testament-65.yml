Title: Salvation by faith and not by works
Book: 'Galatians: Freedom in Christ (Gal. 2:4)'
Scripture: Gal. 1-3
Truth: Christ live in me
Verse: Gal. 2:20 “ I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live,
  but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith
  in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me”
Summary: |-
  Paul and Barnabas were in an area called Galatia (Acts 14). They heard that some of the believing Jews told the believing Gentiles that they should keep the whole law if they wanted to be real believers in Jesus (Gal 1:6). Paul wrote a letter to the believers in Galatia so they would remember that all people are saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in His righteousness and not by keeping the law (which is impossible). Only Jesus (who is God and man) fulfilled the whole law (Rom. 8:3-4). Paul wrote, “knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified” (Gal 2:16). Believers understand that Jesus fulfilled the whole law and  gives them new life. “For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. “ (2:19-20).
  Abraham was justified by faith and God gave him the promise, “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed: ”9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.” (3:8) Jesus died for us “that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” (3:14) The Law was given after Abraham and acted as a “harsh tutor” that showed us that we couldn’t be perfect in our own strength. Now, we are not under Law because Jesus already came. “For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (3:26-29)
Character:
- Jesus is Savior
- He fulfilled the whole Law
- Jesus gives believers in Him new life
- Jesus saves by grace
- Jesus unites believers with Himself
Application: |
  Jesus saves me and everyone who believes in Him by grace. Trying to fulfill the law doesn’t save me. I am wrong if I think that God will accept me if I do good works. God accepts those who put faith in the perfect life, sacrifice and victory of Jesus. I trust the righteousness of Jesus and not my “righteousness”. When I believe in Him, by grace, He forgives my sin and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit, who lives in me and helps me to live pleasing to God.
  __Jesus, I believe that my salvation is through Your righteousness. Help me to tell others that You are the only Savior, the One who fulfilled the Law, lived a perfect life, gave Your life as a perfect sacrifice, died and rose again to justify me and all those who believe in You. Help me to not rely upon my own strength, but to rely upon You and Your Holy Spirit to live for You.__
