Summary: |+
  Ch. 8: God fulfilled His Word that He spoke earlier through Elijah that Hazael would be king in Syria (1 Kings 19:15). New kings ruled in Israel (Ahaziah) and Judah (Jehoram) that didn’t love God and acted like Ahab. They fought against Edom*.
  Ch. 9: God anointed Jehu as king of Israel (according to God’s word in 1 Kings 19:16). God used Jehu to judge Ahab’s family, as He said He would.
  Ch. 10: Jehu killed all those connected with Ahab (even the king of Judah) and also, in a sneaky way, he killed all those in Israel who worshiped Baal . However, he didn’t follow God in his heart (v.31).

  * Obadiah: God speaks a word of judgement against Edom. He judged them for their pride (v.3)

  Joel: The prophet talks about a famine in the land and disobedient people. Locusts ate up everything in the land. God calls people to repentance (2:13), speaks of the last days (2:29-32),  promises to pour out the Holy Spirit (2:28) and says that He will judge the nations (3:12).

Application: |
  The time came when God judged Ahab’s house for all their evil. They had done wicked things and didn’t follow God. God also spoke judgement against Edom for their pride. One day, God will punish all those who don’t love and follow Jesus. Often in Scripture, the day when God will judge everyone is called: The Day of the Lord. In the book of Joel alone, the phrase “the Day of the Lord” appears 5 times. When I believe in Jesus and trust Him, I don’t have to be afraid of punishment (1 Jn. 4:17-19). He took my punishment upon Himself on the cross. He takes away the sin of all those who trust in HIm. This is good news! __Jesus, please help me to walk with you all of my days and to love you with all of my heart. Help me to tell others about you, to warn them about judgement and to tell them the good news, that You can take away their sin and guilt. Thank you for your faithful love and compassion. __

  1 Jn. 4:17-19 “In this, love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, for we are as He is in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love because He first loved us.”

  About the prophets:
  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.
