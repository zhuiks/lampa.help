Summary: |-
  Paul and Silas went to Galatia to see the believers and tell them that truly, they are all saved through faith in Jesus Christ and not through works of the law. (Acts 16:1-6). In the city of Lystra, they met Timothy. He fulfilled a Jewish ritual (circumcision) that he didn’t do earlier because his father was a Gentile but his mother was Jewish. “Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. 7 After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them” (Acts 16:6-7)
  God gave Paul a vision of a man in Macedonia. Paul and Silas traveled to Macedonia and were in the city of Philippi (v.12). There, a lady named Lydia and her family believed in Jesus (v.14-15). They all gathered at the river, where they prayed (v.13). Once, on the way there, they met a demon-possessed servant girl. Her master used her to make money (the demon in her would tell fortunes/guess people’s future). The girl followed Paul and the others saying “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation” (v.17).  After hearing this for many days, one day Paul drove the demon out of her in the name of Jesus Christ. The master of the girl was angry because he couldn’t make money using her anymore and complained to the leaders of the city about Paul and Silas. They beat them and put them in prison.
  At night, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praise songs to God and all the prisoners heard them. Then there was an earthquake and the doors of the prison opened. The jailer wanted to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had run away. But Paul stopped him. The jailer wanted to know how to be saved. Paul and Silas said “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” (31) The jailer led them out and, his whole house heard the Word of the Lord, the jailer washed Paul and Silas’s wounds and his household believed in Jesus and was baptized. Then they ate. In the morning, the city leaders released Paul and Silas from prison. Paul said that they put them in prison unjustly and asked that the leaders come themselves to lead them out of prison. Then Paul and Silas went to Lydia’s house, to the believers in Jesus.

Application: |
  Paul, Silas and the others traveled to tell people about Jesus. I also can look for people who don’t know about Jesus, to tell them about His love and salvation. Where can I share about Jesus? In school, at home, on the street, at the playground and even in other countries.
  Paul and the others met a demon possessed servant girl. In the name of Jesus, she was freed from the demon. Only Jesus can free a person. He is God and He controls everything. People who don’t believe in Jesus are under the control of sin and satan. They don’t know what true freedom in Jesus Christ is. I can tell them that Jesus wants to give them forgiveness and freedom. Only through faith in Jesus can a person be free from sin and the influence of satan (who is a fallen angel and is lower than Jesus because Jesus is God).
  For their act of kindness, Paul and Silas were put in prison! I may think that people in prison aren’t free but because Paul and Silas were believers, in their hearts, they were free and they could be joyful and sing songs to Jesus. The others heard them. When I suffer unjustly, I can still be joyful because I know that Jesus is with me. Even when I am suffering, I can praise Jesus and those around me will see that Jesus is my help, my strength and my joy.
  God opened the doors of the prison. Through this miracle, Paul and Silas could share about Jesus with the jailer and his household. They all heard the Word of the Lord and believed in Jesus. People need to hear the truth about Jesus from the Bible. I can share with them what I know about Jesus from the Bible. I can tell them that only through faith in Jesus, we are saved.
  To be in prison because of my faith in Jesus seems scary. But I see how everything works for good. That is, because Paul and Silas were in prison and sang songs to Jesus, the jailer and his family heard about Jesus and God saved them! I don’t always understand how God works, but I can trust Him. I believe that He is wise and kind and that He has a good plan for me and others. __Jesus, help me to be joyful in You always and tell people that You are the Great Saviour! When I’m in a hard situation, help me to remember that you work all things for good!__

  Note: If a question arises regarding Timothy’s circumcision (16:3), it’s important to teach that he wasn’t circumcised for salvation, because we just studied that keeping the law cannot save. He did this because he wanted to minister to the Jews. To become fully a Jew, he had to be circumcised. He did this for the sake of ministry and not for the sake of salvation.
