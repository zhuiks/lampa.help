Summary: |+
  Later,  Saul gathered the army to fight the Philistines,but the people were afraid and hid themselves. Saul did not wait for Samuel and decided to sacrifice an offering to God himself.  Samuel told Saul that because of his disobedience, the kingdom would be given to another (13:13-14). Only Saul and Jonathan had weapons (13:22). Jonathan and his armor bearer went to see if God wanted them to fight the Philistines. He said, “…Nothing can keep the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few” (14:6). The Lord gave them victory. Saul and his army heard the noise of battle. Saul started to seek the Lord’s will about fighting but didn’t wait and decided to fight. He told his army not to eat until the battle was over. Jonathan didn’t hear his father’s order and ate honey.  Later, God didn’t answer Saul when he sought His will. God showed that Jonathan was guilty and Saul wanted to kill him but the soldiers saved him.
  Chapter 15: Samuel told Saul that God wanted to send him to fight against the Amalekites and get rid of everything and everyone. The Amalekites had been mean to Israel earlier when they were coming out of slavery from Egypt. Saul won the battle but let the Amalekite king and the best of his animals live. Later, Saul put up a memorial to himself. Samuel came and told Saul that he had been disobedient to God. Saul did not admit his guilt right away and tried to prove that what he did was ok. God through Samuel said that obeying God’s voice is more important than offering sacrifices (15:22). Samuel also said “you rejected God’s word and He has rejected you, so you won’t be king, but He will set up a new person over Israel” (15:26-29). Saul was very upset and said that he had been afraid of the people and that was why he acted that way. When Samuel wanted to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his clothing and tore off a part of it . He really wanted Samuel to go with him to worship God in front of the people. God was sad that Saul was a disobedient king. Samuel continued to pray for Saul.

Application: |
  The Israelites wanted a king to lead them. God gave them Saul. Leaders can be good but people will always fail.  Jesus is the best King. He is King of kings. I want Him to be the  King of my heart. Saul was afraid of what people thought more than what God thought. He didn’t trust God’s word. When I trust Jesus, I don’t need to be afraid of what people think. I should wait to find out what God thinks about a situation and then act according to God’s will. He shows me His will in His Word.  I should listen to King Jesus. My obedience shows that I trust Him. Just doing things without trusting God isn’t pleasing to Him. God knows my heart and the reason that I do things.  Jesus, help me to not fear people’s opinion but to follow and respect You. Show me in Your Word what is pleasing to You and help me to trust You and do it.__ Give me a heart that loves and trusts You.__
  God is trustworthy. Jonathan trusted God and He gave him victory. Jonathan sought God’s will and then did it. God never fails. However, Jonathan sinned when he didn’t respect his father, Saul, and spoke rudely about him when he heard about the command to not eat. God wants me to respect my parents.
  The fear of the Lord is when we respect and love God more than anyone else. Jesus, teach me to have the right fear of the Lord. You are Great and You are worthy of my trust.
