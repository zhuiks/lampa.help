Summary: |-
  Jesus was visiting someone’s home and when they were at the table, a certain woman came and worshipped Jesus. She anointed His feet with expensive oil, washed them with her tears and out of thankfulness wiped His feet dry with her hair. The host, Simon the Pharisee said that Jesus shouldn’t let this woman even touch Him because she had a bad reputation in the town.
  “And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say it.” “There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.  And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?”  Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more” (v 40-43). Jesus said that the woman loved Jesus very much because she understood how much God had forgiven her. Simon didn’t greet Jesus well into his home in comparison to this woman. “Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” (v. 47). Jesus told her that her sins were forgiven. The people were amazed that Jesus had authority to forgive sins.
Character:
- Jesus is God

- Jesus is worthy to receive worship and adoration
Application: |
  Sometimes I am like Simon, who invites Jesus to be near me but I don’t really respect or love Him much. Jesus, forgive me and give me a heart that understands how much you have forgiven me, so that I would be like the woman who worshiped you out of thankfulness. It’s good to think about the price that Jesus paid for me to forgive my sin. He shed His blood. He gave His life in order to reconcile me to Himself. __Thank you Jesus! I want to respect and love you with all of my life, with all that is important and valuable to me.__
  Jesus didn’t stop the woman from worshipping Him because He is God and is worthy to receive worship. Her heart of worship and not her bad reputation was important to Him. Jesus is worthy of my worship. The bad things that I have done before shouldn’t keep me from coming to Jesus to receive forgiveness and salvation. He wants to forgive me and give me new life in the knowledge of Him.
  The woman was thankful to Jesus. She had sinned before but Jesus had changed her life. She anointed Jesus’ feet with precious oil and didn’t worry about the opinion of others. She simply worshiped Jesus. She demonstrated her thankfulness and didn’t hide her love. I also am thankful to Jesus for salvation and forgiveness. I also want to worship Him with my life. I love Jesus. How can I show Him my love? Am I afraid to show that I love Jesus? Why? __Jesus, I ask you to take away the fear of people and to give me freedom to worship You.__
  Jesus knew that the Pharisees thought poorly of the woman and didn’t understand His words of forgiveness. Jesus taught Simon, so that he would understand. __Thank you Jesus that you teach me when I don’t understand or am thinking incorrectly about something. Help me to understand Your Love and not to judge people. I want to understand more how much you have forgiven me. I want to love you more!__
