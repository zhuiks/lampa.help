Summary: |-
  Paul and Barnabas were in the church in Antioch (according to 14:26-28) when certain Jews came from Jerusalem came and started to teach that the non-Jewish believers should keep the law in order to be saved. Paul and Barnabas didn’t agree and were sent from their church in Antioch to the church in Jerusalem where there was a church council to discuss the question of salvation for the Gentiles (Acts 15). Peter shared about how God saved the Gentiles (Cornelius and his family) and gave them the gift of the Holy Spirit just as He gave the believing Jews. James quoted the prophet Amos, where he wrote about God’s plan to save the Gentiles. (Acts 15:16-18)  They all agreed that Jesus saves everyone by grace and that the law doesn’t save. They agreed that it wasn’t right to teach people to fulfill the law for salvation. They wrote the Gentile believers a letter where they explained this.
  Then Paul and Silas along with Judas and Silas returned to Antioch from Jerusalem and were in the church there. The believers there rejoiced in the news in the letter. Later, Paul wanted to travel with Barnabas again and Barnabas wanted to take his nephew John-Mark with them as he did before but Paul didn’t want to take him because he had left them during their journey. Paul and Barnabas didn’t agree and decided to go their separate ways. Barnabas and Mark went to Cyprus while Paul and Silas were approved by the believers in the Antioch church to go, “and he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.” (15:14)

Application: |
  I am saved by grace and not by works. The church often struggled with incorrect understanding about salvation. Even today, people sometimes get confused. This is why I need to know the Bible and what is written there about God’s plan of salvation. The Bible helps me to resolve problems. When the Jerusalem Council was held, they discussed the work of God and the teaching of the Word about the salvation of the Gentiles. This helped them to see the truth that God saved all people by grace. Then all people had unity in the truth. Sometimes believers don’t agree with one another. It’s good to discuss problems together with believers and to look at what the Bible says about it.
  The Church (a group of believers) sends people out to share about Jesus and supports the “sent ones”,  missionaries. Later, the missionaries returned to the church that sent them out in order to share with them about God’s work. Paul and Barnabas were sent from the church in Antioch and returned there to share about God’s work. They were missionaries. I can pray for missionaries that I know. Maybe God wants to send me as a missionary somewhere. The Holy Spirit will lead and guide me and the family of God in the church will send me and pray for me.
  Sometimes good friends in Christ don’t agree with one another and God wants them to do different things. Barnabas, whose name means “son of encouragement” was an encouragement for Mark in his faith, just as he had encouraged Paul earlier (Acts 4:36, 9:26-27). Maybe Mark wasn’t mature when he left Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13) but later, Paul wrote about Mark, saying that he was a mature believer and servant in the church. Paul even called Mark his son. To read more about John Mark see: Acts 12:12, 13:13, Col. 4:12, Philemon 1:24, 2 Tim 4:12, 1 Pet 5:13. God can grow my faith. He uses people like Barnabas to help me grow in faith. Maybe in the future he will use me like Barnabas to be an encouragement to a younger believer. __Jesus, I want to know You better and love You more. Help me to trust You. Teach me the truth of your Word and lead me by your Holy Spirit.__
