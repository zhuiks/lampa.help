Summary: |+
  God spoke to Israel through the prophet Zechariah: “Return to Me…and I will return to you, says the Lord of Hosts” (v.3). The 70 years of Babylonian captivity had ended and according to God’s Word, the people returned to the land of Israel! God gave Zechariah 8 visions in the night about the restoration of Israel, showing them mercy and saying that the temple would be rebuilt. (1:13-17). God said that the day would come when He would cleanse His people and remove their sin (3:8-10). Regarding the restoration and rebuilding of the temple, He said, “So he answered me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of Hosts. 7 ‘What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. And he will bring out the capstone accompanied by shouts of: Grace, grace to it!’” (4:6-7).
  God spoke of the Branch, who is the King and Priest (6:12-13). God told His people “make fair decisions. Show faithful love and compassion to one another.” (7:9). God spoke about the coming of the Messiah King (9:9, 14:9). 12:10 says that Israel will look upon the One they pierced and mourn.

Application: |
  God is the One who renews me. The people of Israel were disobedient and for 70 years were in captivity in Babylon. Then, by God’s Word they returned to the land and God helped them to rebuild not only the temple but to rebuild their relationship with God and one another in a right way. When I believe in Jesus, He forgives my sin and renews my life. God has a good plan for me when I seek Him and follow Jesus. It’s good for me to remember that just as the people couldn’t rebuilt the temple in their own strength but God gave them help from the Holy Spirit to do it, so also I can’t live God’s way in my own strength but God gives me His Holy Spirit to live pleasing to Him. Everything is by His grace!
  In the book of Zechariah, God says a lot about Jesus. We know that some of these verses have already been fulfilled because Jesus already came, lived on earth, died on the cross, rose from the dead and returned to heaven. But we are waiting for His second coming when He will take His own to be with Him, punish and judge the unbelievers and reign as King forever. I believe that Jesus is coming soon! I want to live each day for His glory and tell people about Him so that they won’t perish but will have eternal life through faith in Jesus. Jesus saves us by His grace.
