Summary: |-
  Paul writes that Titus and some other brothers were going to Corinth. The church was preparing an offering to support other believers in their need. (8:14) “God loves a cheerful giver” (9:7)
  Someone questioned Paul’s authority to speak to and correct the Corinthian church.He wrote,“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (10:3-5) God gave Paul a responsibility to build up believers and to not destroy their faith (10:8) False teachers came to Corinth and Paul was concerned about the believers there. (11:4) The false teachers seemed to be right but even satan can look like an angel of light. (11:13-15) Paul had many concerns for those who heard the gospel and this proved that he didn’t live for himself but for Christ, that people would know Jesus. (11:22-30)
  God showed Paul a vision of heaven and afterwards, humbled him with a physical ailment . Paul asked 3 times for healing and wrote, “And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” (12:9-10)
  Paul was ready to serve and love believers there even if they didn’t love and respect him. He wanted them to be edified in Christ. (12:15, 19) He planned to go to Corinth and wanted the church to trust Jesus. “ Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified. ” (13:5)  He wanted people to live by faith in Jesus and not in sin. “Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (13:11) “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.” (13:14)

Application: |
  During Paul’s time, the believers were helping one another in their need. Today also, believers all around the world support one another in prayer and materially. How can I help my brothers and sisters with their needs? I can pray for them or maybe pass on some of my unneeded clothing to them. __God, show me how to be a cheerful giver.__
   People came to Corinth and said bad things about Paul. But Paul’s life proved that he wanted to edify believers and not ruin them. He always spoke about Jesus and wanted people to follow Jesus. There will be false teachers in churches. There will be people who will say bad things about others. My job is to hold on tight to the truth about Jesus in the Bible, check everything that they say with the Word of God and also look at the lives of those who are speaking poorly of others. Jesus, guard me from deceit. A true teacher from God will edify my faith in Jesus and not tear it down .
  God wants me to be close to Him. He doesn’t want me to continue in a sinful lifestyle. That’s why Paul wrote, “Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. “ (13:5) __Holy Spirit, show me my heart and correct me. I want to trust Jesus in everything and live pleasing to Him. Give me Your strength, wisdom and love. I love You, Jesus.__
