Application: |
  I know that Jesus is coming again to rule on earth, defeat His enemies and fulfill the hope of all who believe in Him. Scripture says that Jesus is King over all. It’s not important when someone lived (long ago or now), where they lived (in the jungle or in a muslim country), or who they were (rich or poor). Jesus is king over everyone. He is the One and Only Savior and King. People who don’t trust Him will be punished forever. People who trust Him will be rejoicing forever with Him! Do I believe that Jesus is King? Do I entrust my life to Jesus? Do I want to share with people about Jesus and about the hope that I have in Him? If I answer yes, I can ask for help from the Holy Spirit to know how to share with people. If I answer no, I can ask Jesus to give me love for Him and for others. If we want to love Him more, we can ask and He will help us!
  When life is difficult here, I can remember the living hope that I have in Jesus. When I believe in Jesus, I have a place in His kingdom. I will be with Him where there are no tears, no pain and no sin! I can rejoice in the hope of heaven!
