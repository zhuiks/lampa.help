Summary: |
  Charitable giving: When giving, don’t do it before people in order for them to see your good works, but do it secretly, with humility (v.1-4). Prayer: Prayer is before God and not to show off before people. Jesus taught how to pray (v. 5-15). Fasting: keep a fast secretly and not to show off before people. It is done before the Heavenly Father. Treasures and Cares: Don’t gather treasures on earth, which are temporal, but gather treasures in heaven “for where your treasure is, there your heart is.”(v. 21). “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon” (v. 24). The Heavenly Father takes cares of His own and knows their needs. Do not be anxious. “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (v.33).

Application: |
  Jesus taught about how my heart should trust Him and the Heavenly Father. I don’t do good things so that people would see me and think that I’m good. If I give money or pray or fast, I do everything before God and not before people. God is my Heavenly Father who sees me always.He knows the motives of my heart. He knows if I do things out of love for Jesus and others or for my own glory. __Jesus, help me to do things before the Heavenly Father and not before people.__
  Jesus taught that I can’t live for myself and for Him at the same time. I can’t live for riches and prestige in life and for God’s glory. God is worthy of my whole life. He cares for me today and always. He is my security. He cares for all of my needs. His kingdom is in heaven. Jesus said that I should seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and he promises that all things will be added to me. How can I seek the kingdom of heaven? The kingdom of heaven is where Jesus reigns. Jesus is most important. I want Him to be the most important in my heart. __Jesus, help me that You would always be the most important in my life. All that you do, Jesus, is right. Teach me to do what is right and pleasing to You.__
  I can pray, read the Bible and listen to the Holy Spirit when He leads me and shows me how to follow Jesus. I can ask Jesus for help to love God and others. When I love Jesus, then I love others,  live pleasing to Him and will naturally seek God’s kingdom because I want to do what makes the Heavenly Father glad. __Thank you God, that You help me to seek Your kingdom and You promise to care for my needs. I love You!__
