Summary: |-
  Paul wanted to kill the believers in Jesus. He went to Damascus with a letter to arrest all the believers in Jesus. On the road there, a light from heaven shone on him. “Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” Then the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.It is hard for you to kick against the goads.” So he, trembling and astonished, said, “Lord, what do You want me to do?” Then the Lord said to him, “Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do” (v. 4-6). He was blind and couldn’t see for 3 days.
  God told Ananias to go to Saul. He was afraid, “But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel” (v. 15). He went to pray for Saul and God opened his eyes. Saul was baptized and was with the believers and started to teach in the synagogue that Jesus is God and Saviour. Then some people didn’t agree and wanted to kill him. The believers there, “took him by night and let him down through the wall in a large basket.” (v 25). Later, Saul was in Jerusalem and people didn’t believe at first that he was a follower of Jesus. But Barnabas befriended him. Saul continued to tell people that Jesus is God and Saviour and again people wanted to kill him. His friends sent him to Tarsus (his hometown, verse 11).
Character:
- Jesus is God and Saviour
- God calls us
- God has a plan for our lives
- Jesus changes hearts and lives
Application: |
  Saul (later Paul) didn’t believe in Jesus and wanted to stop believers in Him. People were afraid of him because he was mean and hurt believers in Jesus. But God had a plan for his life and He saved Saul. Do I know someone who is angry towards believers in Jesus? Do I believe that God has a good plan for that person’s life and can save him? God can!
  Even though Ananias was afraid to go to Saul, he was obedient when God called him to go to him. God let Ananias see His big work in Saul’s heart! Does God want me to talk about Jesus with someone?__ Jesus, help me to be obedient when you call me to share about You.__
  Jesus changed Saul! He can change me and other people. At first, Saul told everyone that Jesus was neither God nor Saviour. Later, he told everyone that Jesus is God and Saviour. Some people were angry at Saul when he talked about Jesus but he continued to share. Jesus, give me boldness and wisdom to share about Your salvation and love with people. Saul was living his own way until Jesus changed his heart. Later when Jesus led his life, he travelled a lot and told lots of people in the world about Jesus. I don’t want to live life my way. I want Jesus to lead my life. __Jesus, I trust You and Your plan for my life.__
