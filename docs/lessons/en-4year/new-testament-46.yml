Summary: |+
  Matt 24:1-31 Jesus says that the temple will be destroyed and explains what will happen in the last days. There will be wars,  people who claim to be the Christ, false prophets and persecution of believers. “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.” (v.14)
  Prophecy from the book of Daniel will be fulfilled and the great tribulation will begin. People shouldn’t believe those who say that Jesus has returned already, they should take shelter until it happens. “ For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be” (v 27) Christ’s return will be visible and clear to everyone and He will gather His own to Himself (v, 29-31)
  Verses 32-51 Jesus says that the generation that sees all these signs (the changes in the sun, stars, persecution etc) will see His return. No one knows when Jesus will return and everyone should be ready. “ Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” (v. 44) Those who serve God when Jesus returns will be blessed. Those who do not will go to hell.
  Matt. 25:-13 Jesus told a parable of the 10 virgins who needed to always be ready for the grooms arrival.
  Verses 14-30 Jesus told the parable of the talents. The servant who did not use what was entrusted to him was punished.
  Verses 31-46 Jesus will judge everyone. Those who trust Him will be with Him in His kingdom. “And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ (v. 40) Those who don’t trust Him won’t be in His kingdom. “Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ 46 And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” (46-47)

Application: |
  I believe that Jesus will return. I want to be ready for His return. No one knows when He will return (see Matt. 24:36). In 2 Pet. 3:10 it says, “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up”
  I want to be like the 5 girls who had oil for their lamps. It looked like all the girls were ready for the wedding celebration, but in reality, not all of them were ready. They were standing in the right place (near the door) but only 5 of them had extra oil with them. Oil often symbolized the Holy Spirit. There are people who are in church, but in reality they don’t trust Jesus and don’t have the Holy Spirit (they are not born again). Jesus knows everyone and only those who trust Him will be with Him in heaven.
  I want to be like the servant who used what his master gave him correctly. I want to love and serve God and people until the day when Jesus comes for me. When I love others and serve them it’s the same as serving and loving Jesus Himself (Matt. 25:40).
  Jesus knows the hearts of all and only those who trust Him will be with Him in heaven. He saves those who love and trust Him. Do I trust Jesus? Do I love Jesus? If I trust Him, then I won’t fear Jesus’ return because I know that He saves me. He already saved me from sin and He promises to save me from God’s wrath.
  I want to tell people about salvation in Jesus so that they wouldn’t go to hell where there is eternal torment. Jesus is the only One who can forgive sin and change the hearts of people. Jesus is Savior!
