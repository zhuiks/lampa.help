Summary: |+
  Adam and Eve had 2 sons. Abel was a shepherd and Cain was a farmer. They brought offerings to God. Cain brought the fruit of the ground and Abel brought the firstborn of his flock. God was pleased with Abel’s offering but not with Cain’s offering. Cain was angry. God told him to do what was right and warned him of the sin in his heart. Cain killed his brother Abel. God required Cain to answer for his sin. Cain didn’t want to admit his wrong to God. God punished Cain and he went to live in a different place.

Application: |
  “By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks” (Heb. 11:4). Abel trusted God and this is why God received his offering. God always looks at the heart. He sees everything. God saw that Cain’s heart was not right and that he didn’t bring his offering in faith. God warned him but Cain didn’t love God. When we don’t love God we cannot love others.
  God sees my heart. He sees when I trust Him and when I don’t. Jesus helps me and frees me from the bad things in my heart. He was the perfect sacrifice for my sin. He shed His blood and now people don’t need to bring animal sacrifices to God. Jesus forgives my sin and cleanses my heart. When I love and trust God, I can love others. If I don’t love and trust God, I can’t love others. I may envy them or hate them. But Jesus is my help! He gives me a new heart and strength to love God and others.
