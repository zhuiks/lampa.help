Scripture: Luke 14:15-35, Luke 16
Truth: Jesus offers a good future
Verse: Luke 16:10 “He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and
  he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.” or Luke 16:13 “No servant
  can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else
  he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.”
Summary: |-
  The Parable of the Great Supper (14:15-24) A certain man invited many to a great supper. Those invited at the beginning didn’t come, but those invited later did.
  Counting the Cost (14:25-33) Jesus calls people to love Him above all and calls people to count the cost of following HIm, comparing it to a person preparing to build a tower or a king preparing to go to war.
  Salt (14:34-35): Salt is supposed to be flavorful and if it is not, it is worthless.
  Parable of the Unjust Steward (16:1-9): A certain steward was fired and used his position before he left his job to secure his future.
  (Luke 16:10-13), “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. 11 If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? 12 And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? 13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.” (ESV)
  (Luke 16:14-18) The Pharisees loved money. God knows their hearts.

  The Parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). The rich man lived comfortably and after death, was tormented. He wanted comfort and didn’t find it. Lazarus suffered on earth but after death, was comforted.
Character:
- God knows all hearts
- Jesus rose from the dea
- Jesus gives eternal life
- God invites people to be with Him
Application: |
  The Parable of the Great Supper Who was at the great supper and who wasn’t? Jesus invites many people to be with Him in heaven, but many people don’t want to come. Do I want to be with Jesus or is something more important for me?

  Counting the Cost: Do I know that following Jesus means that I already don’t live for myself? Am I ready to die to my selfish ambitions in order to obtain that which is better and eternal in Jesus?

  Salt: Believers should have an effect like salt (it keeps things from going bad and has a good influence). Those who don’t live for themselves but live for Jesus will be like salt. Those who say they believe Jesus but don’t follow Jesus with their lives are like tasteless salt that has no strength to keep things from going bad and no power to influence their surroundings for the better. Is my life filled with the power of the Holy Spirit? Do I have a positive influence on those around me, so that they would see the Love of Jesus through my life?

  Parable of the Unjust Steward: The unjust steward did not act rightly. Jesus uses him as an example for me, so that I would use what I have wisely and think about the future. The steward in the parable worried about his future and did everything he could so that others would receive him after he was fired. I should be wise and use what God has given me (money, position in society, possessions etc) and think about how they influence my future with God. How can I use money to influence my future in eternity? Maybe I can earn money honestly, buy Bibles and give them to people. Maybe I can give money to people who are working on translating the Bible into other languages, where they don’t yet have the Word of God. __Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to use everything wisely in a way that is pleasing to You.__

  Parable of the Rich man and Lazarus: My life on earth is short in comparison to eternity. God gives people opportunities and chances now  to trust Him and to be with Him after death. Even if I suffer here on earth, but love Jesus, I can know that eternal comfort and joy in heaven with Jesus await me. But people who live for riches now lose everything after death and will only receive torment for their unbelief. __Jesus, please help me to have the right attitude towards life here on earth. Help me to remember that this life isn’t the end. I don’t want to have a selfish attitude towards life and only value what I can have here now on earth, but I want to have an unselfish attitude towards life and value that which endures forever even after earthly life has finished. Jesus, I love to know You and to make You known to people. You rose from the dead and conquered sin in order to give all people eternal life in the knowledge of You!__
