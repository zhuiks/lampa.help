Summary: |
  There was a family that once a year went to Shiloh to worship God. The father of this family had 2 wives. One wife had children and the second one, Anna, did not. The first wife made fun of Anna. Anna was deeply hurt and prayed fervently to God, that He would give her a son. She promised to give her child to serve God. God heard her prayer and gave her a son. Later, she and her husband gave him to God. He lived with the priest and helped in the tabernacle. Anna prayed a prayer of thankfulness.

Application: |
  I can pray to God and know that He hears me. God always answers my prayers. Sometimes He answers “yes”, sometimes “wait” and sometimes He answers “no”. I can thank God for His wisdom. He knows better than I do about how and when to answer. I can entrust (give) my life to God and follow Jesus. God is my support when people make fun of me.
  Anna was a woman of faith. She knew God, loved Him and trusted Him. Look at her prayer in ch. 2 and notice what she knew about the character of God. Look at the last verse. She prayed about God’s anointed one! We know that this Anointed One is the Savior and King, Jesus. Anna lived long before the birth of Jesus but she knew God’s promise and believed that He would fulfill it. I believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, that is, the Savior, The Messiah and King. I want to rejoice in God like Anna did. I want to tell people that He answers our prayers and that He has already sent Jesus, who saves from sin.
