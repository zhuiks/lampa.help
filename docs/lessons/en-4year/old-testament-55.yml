Summary: |+
  God promised David in 1 Chron 17:11-14 that, ”When your time comes to be with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who is one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 12 He will build a house for Me, and I will establish his throne forever. 13 I will be a father to him, and he will be a son to Me. I will not take away My faithful love from him as I took it from the one who was before you. 14 I will appoint him over My house and My kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.’”

  David and others wrote these psalms long before the Messiah’s birth, they contain many details about Jesus’ life and character. Often these verses are quoted in the New Testament where we better understand how they are talking about Jesus.

  (see Lk 24:44-45 Then He told them, “These are My words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” 45 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.)

Application: |
  It’s amazing how many psalms speak of Jesus. I believe that Jesus is God and that God had a plan from eternity to send Jesus to earth to die for my sin and to rise again. 1 Pet. 1:20-21 says, “He was chosen before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the times for you 21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.” I believe that the whole Bible is true and speaks of God’s plan of salvation for people through faith in Jesus. I believe that Jesus is King and that He reigns now in heaven (and in the hearts of those who love Him). One day, He will return and will reign on earth. I want Him to be King of my heart and of my life today and forever. I want to tell my friends and relatives about salvation in Jesus. I want to pray for those who don’t believe in Jesus, that He would become their king.
  *note Messiah means anointed one. Kings were often anointed with oil to show that they were chosen to reign.
