Verse: Jonah 2:9 “...Salvation is of the Lord”
Summary: |+
  Chapt. 1: God told Jonah to go to Nineveh (an enemy city of Israel) and warn the people about God’s punishment. Jonah got on a boat going the opposite direction. God sent a storm on the sea. The sailors found out that the storm was because of Jonah’s disobedience to God. He told them that he believed in the Lord God who made the heavens, the sea and the land. They were afraid of God’s wrath and did what Jonah said when he told them to throw him into the sea. Then the sea was calm and the sailors worshiped God.
  Chapt. 2 God told a big fish (whale) to swallow Jonah and he was in the belly of the whale for 3 days and 3 nights. Jonah prayed to God and said that “Salvation is from the Lord.” The Lord told the whale to spit Jonah out on land.
  Chapt. 3: The Lord told Jonah a second time to go to Nineveh to speak His Word there. Jonah decided to listen and told the people of the city that in 40 days, God would destroy their city. The people listened, believed God’s Word and repented. The king told people to fast and to turn from their evil ways and ask God for mercy. God saw that they turned from their evil ways and he decided to show them mercy.
  Chapt. 4: But Jonah was upset that God showed them mercy. Jonah sat down overlooking the city. God made a plant grow over his head to give him shade from the sun and Jonah was glad. But later, God sent a wind to dry up the plant. Jonah was upset and wanted to die. God showed him that it wasn’t right that Jonah felt bad about the plant and didn’t feel bad for the people of Nineveh who didn’t understand right from wrong.

Application: |
  God was merciful to the Ninevites and to Jonah. I can’t run away from God like Jonah wanted to. It’s dangerous to be disobedient to God. God forgives me and saves me when I call out to Him. I know that Jesus wants to save all people, even people who seem to be my enemies. God wants people to turn to Jesus.  Jonah wasn’t glad, but I can be glad about God’s plan to save people. Maybe God wants me to tell my enemies about salvation in Jesus.  Jesus, help me to remember that I don’t deserve your kindness, no one does, but that’s why the gospel is such good news!  Please  give me a compassionate heart for unbelievers and help me to share Your love and mercy with them and to warn them of God’s wrath.

  About the prophets:
  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.
