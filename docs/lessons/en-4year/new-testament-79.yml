Title: Salvation by faith in Jesus
Book: 'Roman: Redemption in Christ'
Scripture: Rom 9-11
Truth: God has a plan for Israel
Verse: Rom. 10:9-10 “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe
  in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with
  the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made
  unto salvation. “  or Rom 10:13 “ For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall
  be saved” or Rom 10:17 “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word
  of God.”
Summary: |-
  Paul wanted the Jews to believe in Jesus but many of them didn’t believe. Many of them tried to find God through works, through the keeping of the Law, and not by faith. (9:2) God shows mercy to whom He wants. He showed the Gentiles mercy when Jesus died for all and not only for the Jews.
  Righteousness is given through Jesus and not through the Law, “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.” (10:4) “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. ” (10:9-10) “ For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved”How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!” (10:13-15) “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (10:17)
  God has a good plan for the Jews. Through them He gave God’s Word and sent Jesus. Now, the Gentiles through faith can become a part of  God’s “family tree”. Gentiles should be thankful that God allowed them to be a part of His family. Now, few Jews believe in Jesus because it is the time for the Gentiles but, “…all Israel will be saved… For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable”  and later many Jews will believe.(11:26, 29)
Character:
- Jesus is God’s righteousness for believers
- Jesus fulfilled the Law
- Jesus is Savior for the Jews and Gentiles
- God has mercy upon whom He wants
Application: |
  I believe that Jesus is my righteousness. I have no righteousness of my own. I can’t do enough good deeds or keep the law in my own strength in order to be right before God.  I am saved only through faith in Jesus. Jesus is the only Savior for all people. There is no other Savior and no other way. I am thankful that Jesus died for me and not only for Jews.__ Jesus, I want people to know You as Savior and Lord. Help me to share the Word with people because faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God.__
