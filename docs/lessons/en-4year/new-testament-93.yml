Summary: |
  Jude was the brother of James (see Matt. 13:55, Acts 15:13 and Gal. 1:19) and Jesus. Jude wrote this letter so that believers would stand for the faith. There were dishonest people in the church who 1) twisted the understanding of grace in order to live in worldly ways 2) rejected God as Master and Jesus Christ. He wrote that God would judge such people and gave examples from the Bible of how God earlier judged non-believers, unrighteous people and angels. There will be a judgement day (v. 6). “Nevertheless, these dreamers likewise defile their flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme glorious ones.“(verse 8), although even angels don’t speak against other angels but ask that God Himself would rebuke them (verse 9). Jude wrote how they are spiritually dead and don’t do what they should. They aren’t fulfilling the purpose for which they were created. They will be judged, as Scripture says (verse 15).
  Jude wrote that believers should, “But you, dear friends, as you build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, expecting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life. 22 Have mercy on those who doubt, save others by snatching them from the fire; have mercy on others but with fear, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.” (20-23). God keeps believers pure in joy. God is the greatest and eternally worthy of praise.

Application: |
  I understand that in the church there may be dishonest people who don’t want to follow Jesus and His Word. God will judge such people. God wants me to believe correctly about Jesus and live in purity. The Bible is the truth, and this is why it’s important to know what is written in it. Jude wrote about how I should treat people who have gone astray. I should show them mercy but be careful so that I don’t start to do what they are doing. Jude gave practical advice in verses 21-22:  I can build myself up in my most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit,  and keep myself in the love of God, expecting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life. When I read the Bible and ask Jesus for help to wait in the Spirit and live pleasing to Him, He answers and helps me. Jesus is most important for me. He is my authority and my life. __Jesus, help me to hold on to the truth and always submit to You. Thank you that you keep me! You are faithful!__
