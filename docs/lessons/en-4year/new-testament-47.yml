Summary: |-
  Peter and John found the place to celebrate Passover, just like Jesus told them. Jesus ate with His friends. He loved them and washed their feet. He said “For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.  Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. “ (Jn.13:15-16). Then Jesus explained to the disciples that soon He would die for them. He gave them to drink from the cup and said that the wine was like His blood that He would shed for them. He gave them bread and said that it was like His body that He would give to be broken for them. He said for them to drink and eat and “do this in remembrance of Me “ (Luke 22:19). Jesus said that He knew which one of the disciples would betray Him (Jn. 13:21). Judas Iscariot left and betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill Him. Jesus told Peter that he would deny Jesus 3 times. Peter didn’t believe it.
