Summary: |-
  Jacob favored his son Joseph and gave him a special coat. Joseph had dreams that he would be important in his family. His brothers envied him and sold him into slavery. He was a good servant in the house of Potiphar. Potiphar’s wife lied about Joseph and said that he sinned when in reality he had run away from sinning. Joseph was put in prison and became the head helper there. While he was there, God told him the meaning of the dreams for 2 of Pharaoh’s servants. Joseph stayed in prison for 2 more years. Later, God told him the meaning of Pharaoh’s dreams. Pharaoh rewarded Joseph and made him the head of Egypt (after Pharaoh). God blessed Joseph.
