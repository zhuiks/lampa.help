Summary: |
  Ch. 11: David took the wife of Uriah for himself and she became pregnant. David acted deceitfully so that Uriah would die in the war. David did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
  Ch. 12: God sent Nathan to David to convict him of his sin. David repented before God (see Ps. 51). God forgave David but said that there would be consequences for his sin (v. 10-14). The son of Bathsheba and David got sick. David fasted; God took the child to be with Him. Later, David and Bathsheba had a son, Solomon, and God loved him.
  Ch. 13: David’s son, Amnon did evil against his sister, Tamar. Her brother, Absalom took revenge and killed Amnon. Absalom ran away to another city.
  Ch. 14: Absalom lived for 3 years in Gershon. Later, Joab arranged for Absalom to return to Jerusalem. Absalom returned and only after 2 years saw his father, David.
  Ch. 15: Absalom acted deceitfully and “stole” the hearts of Israel. He took over David’s kingdom. Some people who had served David, decided to serve Absalom. Some people remained faithful to David. David left Jerusalem with his people (see Ps. 3).
  Ch. 16: When David left Jerusalem, certain people treated him poorly. Absalom entered Jerusalem. One of David’s counselors, Ahithophel, was on Absalom’s side.
  Ch. 17: Ahithophel, told Absalom how to fight against David, but David’s friend, Hushai, gave different advice that saved David. God worked so that Absalom followed Hushai’s advice. Ahithophel killed himself. David and his people crossed the Jordan river. One of David’s friend brought them food and other help.

Application: |
  David was a great king and started to think that he could do whatever he wanted. He didn’t fear God when he took Uriah’s wife and killed him. Maybe David thought that no one saw him, but God saw everything. God punished David because He loved him and wanted David to return to Him. David repented. God was very merciful to him, in that He didn’t kill David. David broke God’s commands. When David returned to God, He forgave him. Later, there were many problems in David’s family because he had taken many wives and didn’t raise his children right. During David’s suffering because of his sins and mistakes, God helped him. He is faithful and merciful.
  I want to fear God, that is, respect God and be humble before Him. He is a great King and He is worthy of obedience. When I sin, I am not respecting, loving or fearing God. Sometimes one wrong, selfish decision leads to many problems. Jesus is always ready to forgive my sin and change my heart, but I need to understand that sin is harmful and dangerous and wounds me and those around me. Jesus, help me __to see dangerous situations and to seek to fulfill Your will and not my own. Remind me of examples from the Bible, so that I would turn to You and give you glory with my life. Help me to love You and Your Word. Help me to respect You above all.__
  The end consequences for people who live for their own glory and don’t fear God is frightening and sad (Amnon, Absalom, Ahithophel, Sheba). God doesn’t want me to continue to live my way. That’s why He disciplines me, so that I would follow Him, love Him and in the process become more like Jesus.
