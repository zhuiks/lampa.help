Summary: |+
  Ch.20: The king of Syria (or Aram) planned to fight against Israel (Samaria). A prophet came to king Ahab and said that God would give him victory. He did. In the spring, the Syrian king again came against Israel, thinking that God couldn’t help Israel if they fought in a field. God again sent a prophet to say that God would give them victory, so that Israel would know that He is God. However, King Ahab made a mistake and didn’t kill the king of Syria. God showed Ahab through a prophet that now he would die because he didn’t do what God had wanted. Ahab went home resentful and angry.
  Ch. 21: There was a vineyard near Ahab’s house that belonged to Naboth. Ahab wanted to buy it but Naboth didn’t want to sell it. Ahab was upset and his wife, Jezebel made a plan to take Naboth’s vineyard. She invited evil people to a banquet with Naboth. The evil people said bad things about Naboth and killed him. Then, Ahab took the vineyard. Later, God sent Elijah to Ahab and said that God would judge Ahab’s family and that they would die for their evil deeds and idol worship. But Ahab humbled himself before God. God decided to fulfill His prophecy against Ahab’s family after his death.
  Ch. 22: After 3 years, the kings of Israel and Judah fought against the king of Syria. King Jehoshaphat of Judah wanted to know God’s will. There were different “prophets” who spoke what king Ahab wanted to hear. The king of Judah wanted to hear from God and not from people. The prophet Micaiah, who spoke the truth was there. Ahab didn’t like him because he didn’t like to hear what he said. Micaiah said that Ahab would die in battle that day. Having heard the prophecy, Ahab disguised himself in battle. During the battle, someone shot an arrow without aiming and it happened to hit Ahab so that he died, just as God had said. After than, his son Ahaziah, who worshiped false gods, reigned. What he did was wrong in God’s eyes.

Application: |
  God wanted Ahab to get rid of the enemy when they attacked Israel. I can think of sin as my enemy. Selfishness and  pride, for example are enemies that attack my heart and mind. Do I try to befriend these enemies of my soul or do I ask God to help me to fight against them. Lord God, is there something in my heart that is not pleasing to You and Your Holiness? Jesus help me to “kill” that which is not pleasing to Him. If I don’t fight against sin in my life, in the end, sin will kill me.
  Ahab was greedy when he wanted Naboth’s vineyard. Is there  greed in my heart? Jesus can forgive me and change me. Jezebel didn’t value Naboth’s life and helped to kill him in order to get what she wanted. Have I ever acted like that by not caring about someone else and hurting them in order to get what I wanted?
  The prophet Micaiah shared God’s Word with people even though people didn’t like to hear what he said. Am I ready to tell the truth even when others want me to agree with a lie.__ Jesus, help me to live and speak in a way that is pleasing to You.__
