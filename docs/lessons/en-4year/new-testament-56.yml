Scripture: Acts 6-8:1-8
Truth: Jesus receives us into glory
Verse: Mark 13:11 “So when they arrest you and hand you over, don’t worry beforehand
  what you will say. On the contrary, whatever is given to you in that hour—say it.
  For it isn’t you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.” or Ps. 73:24 “You will guide me
  with Your counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.”
Summary: |-
  Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit and God did miracles through him (Acts 6:5, 8). Some people wanted to argue with Stephen but they couldn’t fight with him because he answered wisely. They decided to say bad things about him so that the leaders would kill him. When they judged him, his face was like that of an angel’s. Stephen told them the history of Israel, how God saved them and how they worshipped Him. He told them that they weren’t being obedient to the Holy Spirit and that they killed Jesus, the Just One (Righteous One). The leaders stoned Stephen but Stephen saw Jesus standing in heaven and he said to Him, “Lord, do not charge them with this sin.” and he died. The believers buried him and cried. Saul had approved of his death and started persecuting believers in Jesus. They were driven out of Jerusalem and started to live throughout Judea and Samaria. God started to save people in those places through them when they shared about Jesus.

Application: |
  Stephen loved Jesus and people. He served people in the church and wasn’t afraid to share with people about Jesus. Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, gave him the words that he spoke to his accusers. Jesus was near to Stephen when he suffered for his faith in Him. God helped him to love his enemies even when they threw rocks at him. Because he wasn’t afraid to share about Jesus and die for his faith, other believers also continued to share about Jesus and many people were saved.
  Jesus also gives me the Holy Spirit so I can wisely and lovingly share with people about Him. Sometimes people don’t want to hear what I say about Jesus. Jesus gives me love for them even when they may wrongly accuse me. He is with me when I’m having a hard time. He promises to receive me into His kingdom and glory after this life.
  Through faith in Jesus, God can even turn the difficult things in my life into good and use them to bring more people to Christ. __God, give me love for You and boldness to speak about you and not to fear people. Use my life, so that many people would trust Jesus!__
