Summary: |-
  After Paul was in Corinth, he went to Antioch. Along the way, he stopped in Ephesus and they asked him to stay longer, but he declined, saying that if it was God’s will, he would return to them. He was in Antioch and later went back to the regions of Galatia and Phrygia (modern day Turkey) to strengthen the disciples (18:23) Aquila and Priscilla were in Ephesus. They met Apollos and helped him to better understand the truth about Jesus. The brothers there encouraged him when he decided to go to Achaia and share about Jesus there.
  Later, Paul came to Ephesus and shared with people about Jesus. They had never heard of the Holy Spirit and didn’t know about the baptism of Jesus. They were then baptized in the name of Jesus and also received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Paul taught about Jesus in the synagogue for 3 months but then people opposed him and he gathered with the disciples in the school of Tyrannus for 2 years. Many Jews and Gentiles heard about Jesus there. (19:8-10)
  God did many miracles there and healed people. There were some people who didn’t trust Jesus who wanted to cast demons out of a man. The possessed man beat them. Everyone was afraid and the believers decided to burn their magic books. “So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.” (19:20)
  Paul decided to travel on, but before he left, “…about that time there arose a great commotion about the Way“ (19:23) Demetrius and others who made silver idols didn’t like Paul teaching people to worship the living God and not idols. Their business suffered and Demetrius stirred people up so that they gathered in the stadium and yelled “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!“ (19:28) They yelled for a long time and only the city clerk could quiet the crowd. After this, Paul said goodbye to the disciples and left for Macedonia. (20:1)

Application: |
  I can always know more about Jesus and love Him more. Apollos knew about Jesus, but Aquila and Priscilla taught him more about Him. Just like Apollos, I can share with people about Jesus. Paul told believers in Ephesus about the Holy Spirit. Do I know about the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is God. He fills and overflows believers in Jesus. He gives me strength to witness about Jesus (Acts 1:8). He teaches me and guides me. Often in the book of Acts, I read about how the Holy Spirit showed believers where to go or gave them wisdom to share about Jesus. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit.
  I know that Jesus has authority over everything and everyone. I submit to Him. People wanted to drive demons out in the name of Jesus, but they themselves didn’t know Jesus. The demons submit to Jesus and not to people. They submit to Him because Jesus is God and He is Almighty. Believers in Ephesus saw that only Jesus is worthy of worship and this is why they burned their magic books that were not pleasing to Him. __Holy Spirit, show me if there is anything in my life that is not pleasing to You, so that I would remove it and be sanctified unto You.__
  Paul taught for a long time in Ephesus. As always, there were people who believed in Jesus and those who didn’t. __Jesus, help me to share with people about You and not grow weary when some people don’t want to love You and follow You. Help me to love You and follow You, no matter what.__
  Demetrius was angry at Paul and his teaching when people stopped buying his idols. He started a riot. Even today, there are people who for the sake of money or power cause problems for believers. I worship Jesus and won’t spend money of that which is not pleasing to Him. Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to act when unbelievers are acting against me and other believers. Despite these events, Paul didn’t stop sharing with people about the only Savior, Jesus! __Jesus, lead me also and help me to share with people about You. You alone are Savior. I don’t want people to go to hell, but want them to be in Your kingdom of Love.__
