  In verses 1-16, Jesus told a parable of the workers in the vineyard. They all received the same wages at the end of the day, regardless of how many hours they worked.
  In verses 17-19, Jesus said that He would lay down His life in Jerusalem and on the third day rise.
  In verses 20-28, The mother of the sons of Zebedee asked Jesus to give her sons a good position in His kingdom. Jesus explained that God the Father chooses who will be where in the kingdom. Jesus said that in the world, people like to have authority over others,  “Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. 27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave— 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (v. 26-28).

Application: |
  Jesus teaches me through His parable that He saves by grace. He teaches that the first will be last and the last will be first. That is, people who first heard about salvation in Jesus (the Jews) and people who heard about salvation in Jesus last (the Gentiles) received the same from the master (God). I am saved by grace through faith in Jesus. After the parable, Jesus reminded the disciples that He would die and rise again in Jerusalem. He wants me to understand how He saves us. I don’t deserve anything, but He gave His life for me and redeemed me so that I could be in His kingdom.
  The mother of James and John thought that Jesus’ kingdom would be like an earthly kingdom, only better. She and the disciples didn’t understand that the heavenly kingdom isn’t like an earthly government. Jesus came to serve us, became a servant and laid down His life. And yet, He is the King of His Kingdom! He is the Servant King. Jesus, help me to follow Your example of love. Jesus showed mercy to the blind men that He healed on the road.
  I shouldn’t think about how much I do for Jesus and how much I “should” get from Him. This is a wrong understanding of God’s kingdom. I am thankful for His grace and mercy towards me, that I can be a part of His kingdom and that He invited me to “work in His vineyard”, that is, to tell people about salvation in Jesus. Jesus, thank You for your grace. I want to tell people that today, they can be a part of Your Kingdom through faith in You.
