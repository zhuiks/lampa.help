Summary: |
  “Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.36 But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd. 37 Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matt. 9:35-38) “And when He had called His twelve disciples to Him, He gave them power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease.” (Matt. 10:1) Jesus sent the disciples to the Jews and said, “And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead,[c] cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.“ (Matt. 10:7-8) He told them that they would be persecuted. “But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; 20 for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.” (Matt. 10:19-20) He said that as people hate Him, so also people will hate His disciples. He told them not to fear them, but to fear God. He said that He came not to bring peace but that there would be division among people because of Him. He called people to take their cross and follow Him. “He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.” (Matt. 10:39) He promised that His disciples would receive a reward. (Matt 10:40-42)

Application: |
  Jesus traveled around to teach people and help them. He wanted people to be a part of His kingdom. Jesus sent His disciples out to do what He did. Today, Jesus calls people to be a part of His kingdom. He wants to teach and help people to understand that He is Savior and King. Through me, He wants to tell people about His love and power.
  Just as Jesus freely saved me by His grace, so I can freely help people and tell them about Jesus. He gives me His Holy Spirit so I can know what to say. He gives me boldness to not fear people, but to fear (that is, to respect and love) God. People can kill the body, but they can’t take my salvation. My physical life on earth will end one day, but eternal life in the knowledge of Jesus is forever! Some people hate Jesus, some people will hate me when I follow Jesus. Jesus Himself endured hatred from people. He understands and helps me. Jesus gave His Life to save us. He didn’t live in a palace and didn’t take money when He preached. I should be like Jesus. He is my example in all things. I don’t live for myself, but for Jesus’ glory. “ I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.” (Gal. 2:20) I find true joy in this. Jesus promises that in heaven, He will reward those who love Him and others. I show my love towards Jesus and others when I do what Jesus did (invite people to come to Him for salvation, tell them about His Kingdom, so that Jesus would become their king, and help those in need in the name of Jesus.)
