Summary: |
  15:1-20 Jesus taught that it’s more important to honor God than the traditions and opinions of people. Outward deeds of the law do not save.
  21-28: Jesus healed a Gentile woman’s daughter because of the mother’s faith in Jesus.
  29-39: Jesus healed many people and seeing that they were with Him for 3 days already, had compassion and miraculously fed them.
  16:1-12: The Pharisees and Saducees wanted to see a sign from heaven. He answered that He would give them the sign of Jonah. Jesus warned His disciples about the “leaven” (teaching) of the Pharisees. They didn’t understand and thought that Jesus was talking about bread, which they had forgotten to take with them. He explained that it wasn’t a problem that they forgot bread, as He could miraculously feed people if necessary.

Application: |
  15:1-20 Jesus teaches me that God’s ways are more important than the opinions of people (their traditions and laws). When people ask me to do something for the sake of tradition which contradicts God’s ways, I should follow God and not people.
  15:21-28 The Gentile woman asked Jesus for mercy and He showed her mercy. She wasn’t a Jewess (a part of God’s people) but she trusted Jesus. I may not be Jewish, but because of faith in Jesus, He shows me mercy and forgives me. Thank you Jesus!
  15:29-39 Jesus healed many people and this gave glory to God. All that I do should give glory to God. Jesus again fed more than 4, 00 people! He cared for their needs. He also cares for me.

  16:1-12 The Pharisees asked for a sign even though Jesus was constantly doing miracles. They wanted to test Him and not trust Him. Jesus said that He would give them the sign of Jonah. He meant that just as Jonah was in the belly of the fish for 3 days, He would be in the “belly” of the earth and then rise again. His death and resurrection would show those who wanted to test Him that He is God. Do I trust Jesus or do I want to test Him? Through His sinless life on earth, His death and resurrection, He has proven that He alone is God and Savior.
  Jesus warned His disciples about the teaching of the Pharisees. What was wrong with their teaching?
  1) They honored the opinion of people more than the opinion of God
  2) They wanted to test and not trust God
  3) They trusted their own “righteousness” and not the righteousness of Jesus.
  __Jesus, help me to trust and honor Your ways more than any other, to trust You and Your righteousness.__
