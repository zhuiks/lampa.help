Application: |
  I can trust God and know that He will provide for me. I believe that He saves me by His grace when I believe in Jesus. God provided Abraham with the ram for the sacrifice instead of Isaac just like He provides Jesus as the sacrifice for our sin instead of me being punished for my sin. __Thank you, God, that You gave us Jesus who died in my place. I believe that Jesus’ sacrifice paid for my sin. I believe that the righteousness of Jesus is necessary for my salvation.__
  Abraham trusted God with his son, who was precious to him. God wants us to trust Him with all that is important and valuable to us. Hebrews 11:17-19 says that Abraham was ready to sacrifice Isaac because he believed that God would raise him from the dead afterwards. I also believe that it’s good to give God whatever He asks me to give to Him. Somehow, He will bring life out of that sacrifice. Jesus died, but He rose again and now because of His death and resurrection, I have life in HIm! God has provided eternal life to me, through faith in Jesus.
  *The teacher may want to discuss in more depth how Isaac is a picture of Christ. Abraham the Father, Isaac called his only son, journeying 3 days (it was as if Isaac was dead for 3 days and then Abraham received him back Heb. 11:19), Isaac carry the wood, Isaac willingly laying on the altar, the ram was sacrificed.
