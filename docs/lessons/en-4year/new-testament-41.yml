Summary: |-
  Verses 1-24: Jesus sent out 72 disciples to share in cities where he planned to go and heal people and share about God’s kingdom. They returned rejoicing about what they had done. Jesus said, “Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.” (v.20) Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit.  (v. 21)
  Verses 25-27: Once, a person asked Jesus “what do I need to do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus asked him what the Scriptures say. The person answered correctly: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’ But then he asked “who is my neighbor?” Jesus answered with the following story: Once a man was traveling on the road and thieves robbed him and beat him. He lay there, wounded on the road. Later, a priest walked by, saw him but didn’t stop to help him. The next person was a Levi. He also passed by and didn’t help the wounded man lying on the road. The third person was a Samaritan. He helped him and paid for his treatment to get better.
  Jesus then asked, which of the 3 people was a neighbor to the wounded man. The answer was, the one who showed him mercy. Jesus said, go and do the same.

Application: |
  In this passage, a person asked Jesus a question. I too can ask God questions and know that answers are found in the Bible. The person wanted to have eternal life. How can I know if I will live eternally with Jesus? Do I love God? Can I love Jesus more? How? In Jesus’ parable, 2 people who were Jews didn’t stop to help the Jew who was hurt. Do I sometimes not help my friends or my parents? Why don’t I help? Maybe I’m in a hurry? Many it’s inconvenient? Maybe I’m afraid?
  Then the Samaritan, who historically wasn’t friends with the Jews, decided to stop and help the man. Samaritans and Jews were enemies, but he helped him. Which people groups today don’t really like one another? What does God want me to do when I see that my “enemy” is suffering?
  Jesus loved me when I was still a sinner and His enemy (Rom 5:10). He died for me and for all people in the world. Jesus loved me and now because I love Jesus and am thankful to Him for salvation and forgiveness and eternal life, I want to love others and show them Jesus’ love. __God, help me to love You and my neighbor. Show me how to love more and give me boldness and strength to love when it is hard.__

  Regarding v. 38-42: Jesus teaches that fellowship with Him (whether we are serving or sitting) is most important. He wants me to love Him and others regardless of what I am doing. Martha served but she was anxious about many things and Jesus wanted her to choose relationship with HIm, something that cannot be taken away. __Jesus, help me to love You and others in all that I do.__
