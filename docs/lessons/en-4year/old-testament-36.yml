Application: |
  In Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the law and reminds people of what God did and said to them. There is a saying “repetition is the mother of learning.” It’s useful for me to read God’s Word and remember: what God tells me, what Jesus did for me, how He provides for and cares for me, what He promises me, why it’s dangerous to forget about God. I can ask Jesus to help me to read the Bible and remember what I read. He helps me to be obedient to God. He gives me His Holy Spirit that gives me strength to follow Jesus and trust Him. He helps me to love God and others.
  God chose Israel to be His special people and He loves them (Deut. 4:37, 7:6-7,10:15).  God also loves me and desires me to know His love and to love Him. He is worthy! Jesus, help me to love you more and more and to trust you and your Word. Your Word says, “…man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord” (Deut. 8:3). Jesus quoted this verse  when He was tempted (see Luke 4).
  In Deut. 18:15-22, God speaks about Jesus as the Prophet that the people should listen to. This is one of the many OT prophecies about Jesus. People waited many years for God to send the Messiah, Jesus. We know that He accomplished His saving work. __Jesus, help us to tell others about your great love and victory!__
