Summary: |
  Ch. 28: David lived in the land of the Philistines. The king there wanted David to fight with him against Israel. Saul was frightened about the war. He wanted to know the future through a medium (spiritist). He knew that he would die in the battle and that as a result of his disobedience, God would give the kingdom to David.
  Ch. 29: The Philistine lords didn’t want David and his people to go to battle with them. They believed that David would fight for Israel and not for the Philistines. They sent David home.
  Ch. 30: David returned home and saw that people had attacked his city and took his family. He asked God for help and God told him what to do. They found their families and returned home.
  Ch. 31: Saul and his sons died in battle. Jonathan also died.

  *Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not. You may want to read some of the psalms that could be from this period of David’s life.
Character:

- He is faithful
- He is our help
- He guides our path in life
Application: |
  God wants us to seek Him and His will. I can know God’s will through the Bible.
  Saul sinned when he didn’t seek to know God better and to know His will, but sought answers from a medium (see 1 Chron. 10:14).
  David was unwise when he lived with the enemies. Later, there were problems when his family was captured. But God was faithful to help David when he turned to God and his hope in God was strengthened (30:7). When I’m having a hard time or don’t know what to do, I can trust God, like David. When I’m in a difficult situation, I can ask God for help. It’s not good to live my own way, like Saul did. I know that God’s promises in the Bible will be fulfilled.
