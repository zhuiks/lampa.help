  Jesus spoke to the people and explained to them who He is. He talked about shepherds, their work, responsibilities and how they treat their sheep. A good shepherd will take good care of his sheep and protect them from enemies. Sheep gather into the sheep pen to rest. Jesus said that He is the door to the place of rest. Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. A shepherd speaks to his sheep that they know his voice and follow him. There are robbers that only want to hurt the sheep (v. 10). Jesus said, “I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep” (v. 11)

Application: |
  Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. That means that He is caring and He protects those who believe in Him. When I believe in Him, He is like my “shepherd” that leads me, speaks to me, protects me and gives me rest and cares for me. He is like a door, which means that through faith in Him I can come into God’s rest.
  There are those who are robbers. They don’t want to care for me. Maybe someone will tell me that I don’t need to believe in Jesus for salvation. They are not telling the truth. Jesus warned me about them. Jesus gave His life for me on the cross. That’s why I know that He loves me. He rose to life on the the third day and He is alive and that’s why I know that He can protect, save and lead me. He loves me and wants me to follow Him. He speaks to me through the Bible and through my conscience (that is, the Holy Spirit speaks to my conscience). I know His voice and I want to follow Him. __Jesus, thank you that you are my Good Shepherd. Help me to hear your voice and follow You. I am glad that You take care of me.__
