Summary: |
  Chapt. 18-22: God wanted His people to be holy because He is holy.  He called them to be different than the nations around them. He wanted them to be pure, kind and respect one another.

  Chapt. 23: God gave the people different celebrations and instructions for them: the sabbath (v.3), Passover (v. 4-8), firstfruits (v. 9-14), feast of weeks (15-21), day of atonement (v. 26-32), feast of booths (v. 33-36). *see note below

  Chapt. 25: God gave His people rules for how to live in the promised land. The 7th year was a sabbath. God wanted the land to rest in the 7th year. People shouldn’t work in the fields that year. The 50th year was the Jubilee: “Then you are to sound a trumpet loudly in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month; you will sound it throughout your land on the Day of Atonement. 10 You are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all its inhabitants. It will be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and each of you to his clan” (25:9-10).

  Chapt. 26-27: God explained the blessings for obedience and the curses for disobedience. He gave instructions for when people made oaths/promises to God.
Character:
- God gives freedom and rest
- Jesus is our rest (our sabbath)
- Jesus is our Jubilee (the One who frees us from the debt of sin)
- Jesus is our source of joy
- Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law
- Everything belongs to God
Application: |
  Maybe it’s hard for me to understand all these instructions from God. I know that the Law was given to show me Jesus. The Law points to  the glorious perfect One, that is, Jesus. God really wants me to be holy and to live a holy life. But without Jesus, I can’t be holy. Jesus is my holiness. He frees me from sin and cleanses me. He gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit who lives in me and helps me to love Jesus and do what Jesus does.
   Before Jesus, God required many sacrifices so that people would understand that sin leads to death and that everything belongs to God. Today, I know that Jesus was that sacrifice. By His perfect life and once for all sacrifice, He fulfilled the whole Law and satisfied God’s wrath against me. I’m  glad that Jesus fulfilled everything for me! Only He could!
  Also, I see a picture of  Jesus through the different celebrations that God gave to His people. The Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee were times of release or freedom. People understood that God gave them rest and freedom. The slaves were freed and people rested from their work. This is a shadow (or picture) of Jesus. I find real freedom in Jesus. He gives my heart peace (like rest). I want to tell my friends and others that they too can find freedom and rest in Jesus. I can’t do lots of good things in order to get rest from God or earn forgiveness and grace from Him. Salvation is God’s gift of grace through faith in Jesus! This is good news!

  *Jesus is the fulfillment of these celebrations:
  23:3 The Sabbath: He is our rest. God wanted people to rest from physical labor in order to teach them that Jesus gives spiritual rest to believers in Him (Heb 4:8-11).
  23:4-8 The Passover: He is our freedom and redemption. Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (Jn. 1:29).
  23:9-14 The Firstfruits: He is the firstborn from the dead (1 Cor. 15:20). He is the first fruit of our salvation.
  23:15-21 Feast of Weeks or Pentecost: He gives us a “harvest” (see Acts. 2). On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon believers in Jesus, they shared with the people about Jesus and many people were saved. All the people who became believers were like a spiritual “harvest”.
  23:23-25 Feast of Trumpets: He is our Help. People blew the trumpets as a warning. The sound reminded them that their sin separated them from God and that they need redemption and cleansing. God wanted them to remember that only He is their help and salvation. I know that Jesus paid for my sin and cleansed me. I can warn others that they are in danger if they don’t believe in Jesus.
  23:26-32 Day of Atonement. Jesus cleanses me from sin. He became a sacrifice for me. He is my righteousness.
  23:33-36 Feast of Booths: He is my provision. God took care of His people when they traveled in the wilderness. They didn’t live in houses, but in tents. Every day, He gave them everything that they needed. Jesus also provides for my needs. I can remember that even though I live here (in a house or an apartment), Jesus is preparing a heavenly dwelling for me and one day, I will live there in heaven with Him!
