Summary: |-
  In a miraculous way, God made a pathway through the sea for the people to cross over to a safe place. All of Pharaoh’s soldiers who were chasing after the Israelites drowned in the sea. God led the people with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Ex. 13:21-22)*. In the wilderness, they wanted to eat and drink. God did miracles. He told Moses to strike a rock and water came forth for the thirst people. Every morning, He gave them “bread” (manna) from heaven. They gathered the manna every morning except for the Sabbath (for them Saturday) morning. On the Sabbath morning they rested because God gave them a double portion of manna the day before. He also sent them birds (pheasants) to eat when they wanted meat. The Israelites often complained to God and to Moses.

  see also Heb. 11:29 “By faith they crossed the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do this, they were drowned.”

  see also 1 Cor. 10:1-7 “Now I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, all passed through the sea, 2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 3 They all ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. 5 But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.6 Now these things became examples for us, so that we will not desire evil things as they did. 7 Don’t become idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play”

  Moses didn’t give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the real bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 Then they said, “Sir, give us this bread always!” 35 “I am the bread of life,” Jesus told them. “No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in Me will ever be thirsty again. 36 But as I told you, you’ve seen Me, and yet you do not believe. 37 Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out. 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me. 39 This is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He has given Me but should raise them up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of My Father: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

Application: |
  Even when it seems like there is no hope, God is strong to help and save us. It looked like the people of Israel were trapped by the sea, but God made a way and saved them! Jesus makes a way for me when there is no hope. He helps me and saves me.
  The people complained to God because they didn’t believe that He was good or that He would help them. This grumbling and complaining was a sin but God in His mercy took care of their needs. I can ask Him for help and believe that He is good and generous and will take care of my needs. God, please forgive me when I complain about… Jesus, help me to ask for your help and trust You instead of complaining.   I can trust God knowing that He knows my needs and loves it when I turn to Him for help. God hears my prayers and He is my help. Jesus is compared to manna (bread from heaven) and the rock that Moses struck (from which water came for the people). Jesus was struck (He died on the cross) in order to give us life. The manna and the rock are pictures to reminds us that Jesus gives us spiritual life. Bread and water are necessary for physical life. Jesus is necessary for spiritual life. __Thank you Jesus, for the life I have in You!__
