  Ch. 3 verses: With the tongue “With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God. 10 Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. 11 Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening? (v. 9-11)
  “But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. 18 Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.” (v. 17-18)

  Ch. 4 verses: “Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?” (v.4)

Application: |
  With my tongue, I say things that are pleasing to God and that are not pleasing to God. I need Jesus’ help to control my tongue. Jesus said that my words come out of my heart, “But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart.” (Matt. 15:18). Only Jesus can give me a new heart that loves God and others. When He changes my heart, He changes my life. __ Jesus, give me a humble heart that depends upon You for life, love and wisdom. Jesus, give me wisdom that brings righteousness. Teach me to be wise, Jesus, and to not seek my own, but to seek what is pleasing to You.__
  When I don’t get what I want, I should examine the motives of my heart and look at my life. Am I living in a way that is pleasing to God? Do I have right desires and relationships with people? If Jesus shows me that there is a desire or action that is displeasing, I should repent and humble myself before God. He loves when I come to Him for help and He promises to draw near to me.
  God doesn’t want me to say bad things about others, especially believers. I myself am not perfect. Only Jesus is perfect and has the right to judge people. If I judge someone, I am saying that I’m higher than God’s Law. Jesus, thank you for Your mercy and salvation. I humble myself before You. I want to trust Jesus with my life, desires and dreams. __ Jesus, give me a heart that trusts you in everything.__
  In chapter 5, James warns the rich who are trusting their riches and aren’t treating others right. I don’t want to trust in riches or abuse authority over people because that is not pleasing to God. Jesus, help me to have a right attitude towards money, knowing that everything belongs to You. All that You give, I want to use rightly, in a way that is pleasing to You. James also writes to those who are suffering and wants them to continue to trust Jesus, knowing that He is coming soon. __Jesus, help me to know, that Your arrival is at hand (soon). Help me to trust You and have expectation in Your Heavenly Kingdom and not in a material kingdom for myself here on earth. __
  God hears the prayers of the righteous. Who is righteous before God? Jesus is my righteousness. When I humble myself before God and recognize that only Jesus is righteous that that His righteousness saves me, then He imputes to me His righteousness and I become righteous before God. Only through Jesus, can I be righteous in God’s eyes. Then, through faith in Jesus, God hears my prayers. __Thank you, Jesus, for Your righteousness, for Your salvation. Thank you that You forgive my sin, heal me and draw me near to You. I humble myself before You. You alone are righteous. I worship You.__
