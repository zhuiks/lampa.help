Summary: |+
  2 Kings Ch. 11: Athalia (the king of Judah’s mother) heard the news that her son died and killed the rest of the family so that she herself could rule. But God helped one son, Joash, to survive and he was hidden in the house of the Lord for 6 years. The priest Jehoiada then gathered the people and said that Joash was king. They killed Athalia and those who were on her side. They destroyed the place of Baal worship in Judah.
  Ch. 12: Joash (sometimes spelled Jehoash) was 7 years old when he became king in Judah and he followed God. He ordered the people to repair the temple. His grandmother Athaliah had used things there for worshiping Baal, a false god (2 Chron. 24:7). When the king of Syria wanted to attack Jerusalem, Joash sent him treasures from the temple and from his house to make him go away. (see also 2 Chron. 23-24 for details about Joash).
  2 Chron. 24: After the death of the priest Jehoiada, Joash listened to the leaders in Judah and started to worship false gods. By the Holy Spirit, Zechariah (son of the priest Jehoiada) said that this was wrong, but the king killed him. Later, the king was wounded in battle and his servants killed him at home. God was angry with them, “nevertheless, He sent them prophets to bring them back to the Lord; they admonished them, but the people would not listen” (v.17).
  Ch. 13: Jehoahaz ruled in Israel. He didn’t follow God and God sent Hazael from Syria (or Aram)  to fight against him. Later, Jehoahaz turned to God and God helped him (v. 4-5). His son (also named Jehoash) fought against the king of Judah. He did what was evil in God’s sight. He visited Elisha when the prophet was dying. Elisha told him to shoot an arrow out of the window and to strike the ground with the remaining arrows. The king struck the ground only 3 times and Elisha was angry. He said that Jehoash would win 3 battles against the Syrians and not completely destroy them. Syria oppressed Israel, but God was gracious and compassionate to them and Syria didn’t destroy them (v. 23).

  2 Chron 25: Amaziah reigned in Judah. He followed God. When I prophet told him not to go to battle with the soldiers from Israel that he hired, he listened and sent them home. God gave him victory against Edom. Then he started worshiping the idols of Edom. When the prophet questioned him, he didn’t want to listen. The prophet said that God would destroy him for his idol worship and disobedience. Amaziah challenged king Jehoash of Israel to fight, but Judah’s army lost and Israel’s army broke Jerusalem’s wall and took gold and silver from the house of God. Amaziah was later killed in a conspiracy. I Kings 14:25 says that the prophet Jonah spoke to the people and God helped Israel to fight for more territory. (1 Kings 14 also details Amaziah’s reign)

  Amos: A little bit after the above events, during the reigns of King Azariah (Uzziah) in Judah and Jeroboam (II) in Israel,  Amos wrote this book. Amos was a shepherd (7:14-15) and prophesied that God would punish king Hazael (of Syria or Aram) along with other nations including Israel and Judah (3:3). God sent them difficulties so that they would return to Him (4:6-13). God warned that He would send them into captivity and also promised to return them to the land (2 Kings 14, 2 Chron 25).

Application: |
  Joash followed God well when Jehoiada the priest was alive. He listened to the advice of someone who loved the Lord. He also repaired the temple. However, when he was older, he listened to the advice of people who didn’t love the Lord. He did evil when he killed Zechariah.  Listening to the advice of godly people is important but it’s also important for me to know and love God for myself. Then I can stand firm in the truth even when opinions or circumstances change.
  This was the case for Zechariah. He loved God and boldly spoke the truth. God gives me boldness to speak the truth (like Zechariah) when believers in Jesus start to walk away from Him. Even if they don’t receive my words, it’s important that I say what God tells me to say. Jesus, please give me wisdom to know what to say and how to say it. Help me to know and love you! God speaks to us through His Word. I can know God’s opinions and will when I study the Bible.
  The book of Amos shows me that God warns us and disciplines us so that we would understand when our ways are sinful and harmful. He wants us to follow Jesus. Jesus reconciles us with God.
  About the prophets:
  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.
