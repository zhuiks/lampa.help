Summary: |
  Is. 52:13-15 and Ch. 53: The suffering servant paid for the sins of many. Detailed description of the Messiah’s suffering, death, burial and resurrection.
  54-66: God has a special plan for Israel, but in these chapters, He describes saving nations that didn’t know Him before. God promises that His people will be with Him (during the 1,000 year reign). A glorious future awaits those who believe in the Messiah, but eternal punishment awaits those who don’t believe in Him.

  Is. 54:14 “and you will be established on a foundation of righteousness. You will be far from oppression, you will certainly not be afraid; you will be far from terror, it will certainly not come near you.”
  55:1 God offers salvation freely. God also says that His thoughts are higher than ours (v.8-9). “So My word that comes from My mouth will not return to Me empty, but it will accomplish what I please and will prosper in what I send it to do” (v.11)
  56:7 God promises to save the Gentiles who follow Him. “I will bring them to My holy mountain
  and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar, for My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.”
  57:15 “For the High and Exalted One who lives forever, whose name is Holy says this: “I live in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and lowly of spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the oppressed.”
  Ch. 58: God says that the  fast which pleases Him is when a person stops living their own way and starts living God’s way. Verse 3 says, “…Look, you do as you please on the day of your fast, and oppress all your workers.” Verse 6 says,“Isn’t the fast I choose: To break the chains of wickedness, to untie the ropes of the yoke, to set the oppressed free, and to tear off every yoke?
  Ch. 59: Our sin separates us from God (v. 1-2). God Himself accomplishes our salvation (16-21).
  Ch. 60: God promises to revive Israel. Many peoples will come to God through Israel. One day, believers will be in God’s presence in heaven. “The sun will no longer be your light by day, and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you; but the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor. 20 Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not fade; for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will be over.”
  Ch. 61: See Luke 4:17-22 when Jesus read and fulfilled these words from verses 1-2. God gives us His righteousness (v. 10).
  Ch. 62: God compares believers to a bride (v. 5). He promises to save and redeem Jerusalem.
  Ch. 63: God will judge the nations. He punished Israel for their faithlessness but Isaiah remembers that God is Father and Redeemer (v. 16).
  Ch. 64: Isaiah prays for God’s mercy and remembers God’s character. “From ancient times no one has heard, no one has listened, no eye has seen any God except You, who acts on behalf of the one who waits for Him.” (v.4)
  Ch. 65: A description of heaven (v. 17-18) and  the 1,000 year reign of the Messiah on earth (v. 19-25).
  Ch. 66:2 “My hand made all these things, and so they all came into being. This is the Lord’s declaration. I will look favorably on this kind of person: one who is humble, submissive  in spirit,
  and trembles at My word.”
  God speaks of judgement upon non-believers and of glory that awaits believers. *Prophecy about Israel becoming a nation (v. 7-9).
Character:

Application: |
  I believe that the Word of God is the truth and that Jesus is coming. He will judge the world. He will reign on earth for 1,000 years. I also believe that all believers will live with Jesus in heaven where there is eternal joy in the presence of Jesus! Now, I want to live for Jesus, follow Him and tell people about Him. Only Jesus gives me full forgiveness, true life, lasting joy and meaning for life. Jesus is my Redeemer and He changes my life. Knowing what a hope I have in Christ, I want to love Jesus more and praise Him with my life!

  *Here is the prophecy that God already fulfilled when Israel became a nation in 1948 (Is. 66:7-9).
