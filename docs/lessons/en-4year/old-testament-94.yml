Summary: |+
  Ezra chapters 1-6 tell about how God fulfilled His promises spoken through the prophets, that the Israelites would be in captivity for 70 years and then return to their land. The people returned and started to  rebuild the temple and altar. They were stopped but then after some years, another king told them that they could build again. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah encouraged people to build. They finished rebuilding the temple and starting worshiping God there. They celebrated Passover.
  Still, there were many Jews who  lived in the lands of their captivity and didn’t return to the land of Israel. Esther was a Jewess, who lived in the city of Susa, in the Persian Empire, where Ahasuerus was king (in some texts: Artaxerxes).
  During a celebration, King Ahasuerus  asked his wife to come and dance for his guests. She refused and the king decided to take away her crown and find a new queen. There was a contest in the land and Esther, who was Jewish, became the new queen. Her uncle Mordechai worked for the king. He heard of a plan to kill the king and saved him. Haman was a prince in the land and wanted everyone to worship him. When he passed by Mordecai, he wanted him to bow to him. but Mordecai would only worship God. Haman got angry when he saw that Mordecai wouldn’t bow to him. He decided to kill Mordecai and all the Jews. He tricked the king into planning a certain day when all the Jews in his kingdom could be killed. Mordecai found out about this and tore his clothes as a sign of suffering and sadness. He spoke with Esther and asked her to talk with the king about her people. But Esther knew that if she went to the king without being invited, she could be killed. Mordecai said,“Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (4:14) Esther asked that all the Jews would fast for their salvation and decided to risk her life and said “if I perish, I perish!” (4:16).

Application: |
  Mordecai and Esther believed God and served the king when it was a difficult time for their people. God gave them influence and a high position so that they could help people. Maybe God put me in a special place at a special time so that I can tell people about Jesus? God gives me boldness and wisdom to tell people about Jesus at home, at school and everywhere where people need to hear the truth. I trust in Jesus and know that He is the Saviour of all who trust in Him. When Jesus calls me to do something for Him for the sake of truth, it is worth taking a risk (just as Esther did).
  God always supplies me with His strength, wisdom and love to fulfill His plan when I ask Him. The most important thing is to love God more than anything and listen to Him. For example, Mordecai didn’t bow down to worship Haman even though he knew that Haman had power. Esther also decided to go to the king even though she wasn’t invited. They trusted God. They also asked others to pray for them when things were difficult. I also can pray to God on behalf of other believers and ask them to pray for me too.
  The Jews fasted and prayed before Esther went to talk with the king. When people fast, they feel hungry because their body needs food. When believers in Jesus fast, they are reminded that their hearts and souls need God. They draw near to God when they fast and look to Him to fill them up, not with food, but with His strength, love and wisdom. When believers fast, they humble themselves (make themselves low) and remember that they are dependent upon God (who is great!) for  everything in life!

  *fun facts: 1) the city of Susa is in modern day Iran 2) King Darius from Daniel ch. 6 is the father of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes or Artaxerxes) in Esther. 3) the name of God is not mentioned directly in the book of Esther but some see it in acrostic form in the original text. that is, God’s name is hidden in the text. Letters spelling YHWH are in certain verses(Esther 1:20, 5:4, 13, 7:7). Although His name is hidden, God is the Saviour and Defender in this story.
