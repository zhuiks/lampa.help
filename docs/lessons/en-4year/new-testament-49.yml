Truth: Jesus is the Perfect Sacrifice
Verse: Matt. 1:21 “...He will save His people from their sins”
Summary: |
  The soldiers and people brought Jesus to judgement to the religious leaders and then to the Roman governor, Pilate. They wanted to kill Him because He said that He is the Son of God and they didn’t believe it. Pilate knew that Jesus wasn’t guilty but he was afraid of what people thought and gave the order to crucify Jesus. During the time of judgement, Peter denied Jesus 3 times, just like Jesus said. Peter cried. Pilate sent Jesus to Herod. The soldiers were very rude to Jesus, beat Him and laughed at Him. Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate wanted to release Jesus but the people asked for a criminal to be released instead. They shouted “crucify Him!” and so Pilate agreed to crucify Jesus.
  Jesus hung on the cross between 2 thieves. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised that he would be with Him in paradise. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the veil in the temple tore from the top to bottom. Jesus said “It is finished!” (Jn 19:30). He died.
  The disciples saw where Jesus’ body was buried, in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it.
