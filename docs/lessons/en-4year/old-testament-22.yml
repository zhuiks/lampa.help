Summary: |-
  God wanted to free the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Moses asked Pharaoh to let the people go, but Pharaoh didn’t want to. God did miracles through Moses and showed the Egyptians that He is the Lord (7:5). Pharaoh hardened his heart and didn’t want to listen to God. God punished Pharaoh and Egypt with 10 plagues. God kept His people safe from the plagues.

Application: |
  I know that God is stronger than everything and everyone. Nothing and no one can stand against God. I  trust God even when other people don’t believe in Him and don’t want to be obedient to Him. I know that Jesus is my defence in difficult circumstances. God did miracles through Moses in order to show that He is the One and Only God and He is stronger than everyone. Pharaoh didn’t want to trust God and so the plagues made life painful and difficult for him and his people. When I don’t trust God, there are painful consequences. It is good to trust Jesus. I want Him to be in control of my life.
