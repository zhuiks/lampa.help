Summary: |
  John the Baptist’s disciples knew that Jesus was also baptizing people. They told John that many people who had been following John had now started following Jesus. John the Baptist said that he was glad that Jesus had come. John said that he himself was not the Christ but simply the one who prepared the way for the groom (Jesus). He said, “He must increase, but I must decrease.” (Jn. 3:30) He also said that Jesus came from above and that He is above all. He taught about Jesus, saying that those who receive Him believe that God is true (3:33).
  When talking with the Pharisees, John explained that Jesus speaks the Word of God and that He gives the Holy Spirit without measure (v. 34). “The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand. 36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him” (3:35-36).

Application: |
  John the Baptist fulfilled prophecy when he spoke to people about Jesus Christ. He was humble and was ready to give Jesus glory because he believed that Jesus was greater than everyone and everything. His life pointed people to Jesus. I want my life to point people to Jesus, so that they would know that He is God, that He is greater than everything and everyone, and that they would have life in Him.
  I believe in Jesus and know that He gives me the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a person of the Trinity and He lives in every believer. When I need help to understand something, to do something,  to live God’s way or to share about Jesus, the Holy Spirit helps me without measure! I can rely upon Jesus. It’s very important for people to believe in Jesus, to trust Him and to love HIm. I have eternal life when I believe in Jesus. Eternal life means: new relationship with God (forgiveness of sins, the filling of the Holy Spirit, reconciliation with God, Jesus’ joy and love, assurance that I belong to God and will be with Him forever). People who don’t trust Him and don’t love Jesus don’t have this life, this joy and this hope. I want to tell them about Jesus so that they would hear about how He is great and how He came to save them. __Jesus, help me by the Holy Spirit to love You and to tell people about You! You are Great!__
