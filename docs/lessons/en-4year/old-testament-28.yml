Summary: |-
  Chapt. 33-34  The Lord said that He would not go with the people into the land that He promised Abraham because they were stubborn (33:4). The people were sad. Moses set up a tent of meeting outside the camp where he would talk with God. The people saw how a pillar of cloud came down at the entrance of the tent when God spoke with Moses. Joshua, Moses’ helper, was in the tent too. Moses asked to know God and His ways. God answered: “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest” (33:14). Then Moses said, “Please, let me see Your glory.” God promised to declare His name to Moses. He told Moses to cut 2 new stone tablets for the law. When he went up to Mount Sinai, God declared His name: “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, 7 keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty…” (Ex. 34:6-7). Moses worshipped God. God said “Look, I am making a covenant. I will perform wonders in the presence of all your people that have never been done in all the earth or in any nation. All the people you live among will see the Lord’s work, for what I am doing with you is awe-inspiring” (34:10). God reminded Moses of the law. When Moses came down from talking with God, the people saw that his face shone and so he wore a veil when he spoke to the people (34:29,35).
  The people built the Tabernacle according to all the instructions that God gave Moses on the mountain. People brought offerings to God of the different materials that were needed for building the Tabernacle. The people whom God gifted to build and weave parts of the Tabernacle did their work (36:1-7). They made the special clothes for the priests too. They set up the tabernacle, anointing every part and the priests who would serve there too. When everything was ready, a cloud covered the tabernacle so that they couldn’t even go into it. This was the glory of the Lord. God’s presence was always with the people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. “The Israelites set out whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle throughout all the stages of their journey. If the cloud was not taken up, they did not set out until the day it was taken up. For the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and there was a fire inside the cloud by night, visible to the entire house of Israel throughout all the stages of their journey” (40:36-38).

Application: |
  Moses and the people of Israel wanted God to be with them and to guide them. They knew that without God, they couldn’t survive. Do I know how important it is that God would lead my life? Do I want God to be with me and to lead me? Do I want Him to plan my life? When I believe in Jesus, He is with me every day and every minute. He has a good plan for my life. He gives me His righteousness. He helps me to live His way. His Holy Spirit lives in me. God wants His people to be holy, as He is holy. Only Jesus can help me to live right. He gives me a new heart that loves God and others. God showed the people when they needed to pick up the tabernacle and move to a new place. Jesus can show me in different ways when I’m suppose to follow Him to new places.
  Moses wanted to see God but this was impossible. God revealed His name to Moses. He is merciful, loving, very patient, and full of grace. How do I see God’s mercy, love, patience and grace towards me? Jesus showed us all these characteristics when He lived and died on the cross and rose again to life. When I read about God and Jesus in the Bible, I understand more who God is and see how He loves me. Through faith in Jesus, we can fellowship with God anywhere and anytime. One day, we will see Jesus face to face (Rev. 22:4)!  Moses’ face shone from being in the presence of God (see 2 Cor. 3:7-18). Through Jesus, we can fellowship with God at any time and in any place.
