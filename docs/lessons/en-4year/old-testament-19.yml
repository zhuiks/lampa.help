Summary: |-
  Just like God said, there was a famine in the land. Joseph sold bread to everyone. Joseph’s brothers came to buy bread. He recognized them but they didn’t recognize him. He put them all in prison for 3 days and after that kept Simeon in prison and wanted them to bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to Egypt. Joseph put the money for the bread back in his brother’s bags. When the brothers came again, they ate at Joseph’s house. He hid a cup in Benjamin’s bag and accused him of stealing it. The brothers wanted to help Benjamin. Then Joseph told them that he was their brother. They were afraid that he would punish them but Joseph forgave them. Later, all the brothers brought their father and they moved to Egypt, because there was bread there. Jacob spoke with Pharaoh. Jacob (Israel) blessed all 12 of his sons. When Jacob died, the brothers were afraid again, thinking that Joseph would punish them. But Joseph said that he trusts and respects God. He forgave his brothers.
  See also Matt. 6:14-15 “For if you forgive people their wrongdoing,your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. 15 But if you don’t forgive people, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoing”
  Eph. 4:32 “And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ.”

  Gen. 50:25 “So Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath: “When God comes to your aid, you are to carry my bones up from here.”
  “By faith Joseph, as he was nearing the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions concerning his bones.”

Application: |
  I can trust God that He will work everything out for good. He forgives me and with His help, I can forgive others. __God, please forgive me for…God, show me who I need to forgive and help me to forgive them right now. __
  Joseph had a difficult life being rejected by his brothers, living in slavery away from his family, being wrongly accused, being sent to prison, and being forgotten there. But he trusted God. He later saw that God used all these things to save many people from the famine. I can trust God in the good and bad things in my life. I know that God is with me and that He has a good plan. Joseph could have been angry at many people, but he forgave those who did wrong against him. Joseph reminds us of Jesus in many ways: He was rejected by the Jews, wrongly accused, punished although He was innocent, forgave His enemies, saved people from death.
  Joseph tested his brother’s hearts when he put them in prison when he said that Benjamin stole the cup. Maybe he wanted to see if they would help their brother or leave him. How I act when things are hard shows God, me and others what is in my heart. __Jesus, please fill my heart with love and grace. When things are hard, help me to forgive, love and do the right thing.__
