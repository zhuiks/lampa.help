Summary: |2+

  Ezra 7-8: Ezra “came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. 10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.” (7:9-10).The king gave Ezra special letter promising him help for teaching people to worship God. Many people decided to go back to Jerusalem with Ezra. They brought a lot of silver and gold articles for worship in the temple. They prayed and fasted to God for a safe  journey and God answered their prayer (8:21-23, 31).

  Ezra 9-10:  Ezra heard that some people had married women who didn’t love God but who worshiped idols. He tore his clothes, pulled some hair from his beard, sat down in shock and didn’t eat until evening time. He prayed to God, admitting that the people were guilty He reminded the people of God sent them into exile and in His mercy brought them back to the land. Many people gathered around Ezra and started crying and confessing their sin (10:1-2). They decided to promise to follow God and not to have the wives that didn’t love God.  They gathered together on a very rainy day and decided to follow God.

  Neh. 1 Nehemiah lived in Susa when he heard that his city, Jerusalem was still in ruins and the walls were still broken down. He cried before the Lord and prayed to Him. He confessed his sins and the sins of his people. He was the king’s cup bearer.
  Neh. 2: When Nehemiah was serving him, the king noticed that Nehemiah’s face was sad. He wanted to know why and Nehemiah explained that his city was in ruins and that he wanted to rebuild the walls. The king allowed him to go to Jerusalem and provided the necessary materials for rebuilding.
  Nehemiah examined the walls of Jerusalem at night. Later, he told the people that God had provided them with help from the king to rebuild the walls. The enemies heard their plan and started to laugh at them but Nehemiah told them that God would help His people (2:20).
  Neh. 3: The people started to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.

Application: |
  Ezra taught people God’s Word so that they could know God. He was sad when he heard that people were not following God’s Word (when they married women who didn’t love God). The people were convicted of sin (realized that they were guilty), they confessed it (admitted their sin to God), they repented and obeyed God’s Word (followed God).
  *Idea for teaching: use gestures to teach the key words: convicted, confession, repentance and obedience. Convicted (strike your heart with your finger, like an arrow is piercing it), Confession (touch your mouth and then bring your hand away from your mouth to show a speaking action), Repentance (turn around from facing one way), Obedience (take a step in the new direction).
  Has God’s Word ever convicted me of sin? Jesus calls me to confess, repent and obey. He is my help and He is ready to forgive me and give my strength by His Holy Spirit to follow Him!
  __Thank you God for Your love and mercy that You show me in Jesus Christ. I want to follow You.__
  I can ask Jesus for forgiveness and know that He forgives me. He hears my prayers (just as He heard Nehemiah’s prayers). I can ask God for inspiration and He will show me His plan and how I can participate in the work of His kingdom (just like Nehemiah was used by God to start rebuilding the walls). When I do what God wants, sometimes people (enemies) will be against me. I am not afraid because God is my help. Jesus gives me strength to continue to do what He has shown me to do.
