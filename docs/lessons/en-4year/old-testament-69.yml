Summary: |+
  Ch. 15: Abijam reigned in Jerusalem. He sinned before God, as his father did. After him, his son Asa reigned. He walked with God. In Israel, Baasha killed Nadab (king in Israel after Jeroboam) and reigned. He sinned against God.

  Ch. 16: God told the prophet Jehu that He would destroy Baasha’s family for their idol worship. Zimri killed Baasha’s son and wanted to reign after him, but Omri attacked Zimri and he died. Omri reigned and after him, his son Ahab. Ahab married Jezebel. She worshiped false gods and did many bad things.

  Chapt. 17: Israel’s kings and the people didn’t follow God. He sent the people his prophet, Elijah, who spoke God’s Word to them. Elijah told king Ahab that there would be no rain in Israel for 3 years because of the king’s disobedience. Then God told Elijah to go east and live by a river, where there was water. God commanded the ravens to feed Elijah. They brought him bread and meat each morning and evening until the river dried up. Then God sent Elijah to a different city where they didn’t know about God and He promised that there, a widow would feed him. He found the widow there and asked for food. She was very poor and said that she couldn’t feed him because she needed to make bread for her son with her last bit of flour and oil. But God said that the flour and oil wouldn’t run out and she agreed to feed Elijah. God did a miracle and the flour and oil did not run out. Later, the widow’s son got sick and died. She told Elijah and he asked God to raise him to life. God gave the boy life! The widow began to believe in God.

Application: |
  God took care of Elijah and the widow. He will also take care of me. God sees my needs. He led Elijah to the river and then to the city where the widow lived. God was glorified (shown to be great and good) in Elijah’s life when God fed him and helped the widow. Jesus leads me to places where He can  be glorified in my life.
  When I follow Jesus, I see that he cares for me even when He calls me to do something that is unpopular (i.e. Elijah spoke to king Ahab). I can trust God even when I have very little of something or when my situation seems hopeless (i.e. the widow). I can share what I have with others and know that all  I have is from God. God does everything for His glory and for my good. When I trust God, it helps others to see that He is great and helps them start to trust Him. __Jesus, thank you that You care for me. Use my life, that others would see how caring and wonderful You are.__
