The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

John would prepare the way for people to receive Jesus. Zechariah questioned the news and the angel told him that he wouldn’t be able to speak until God’s Word to him was fulfilled (v. 20). God said that John would be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb (v 15).\n  An angel told Mary that God chose her to give birth to the Son of God, Jesus. She believed. Mary went to visit Elizabeth (Zechariah’ wife) and praised the Lord. Elizabeth had her son and when Zechariah wrote that his name is John, he was able to speak again. He prophesied about John, that he would prepare the way for the Lord and help the people to understand God’s salvation and forgiveness of sins (v. 77).\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- God fulfills His plan and His Word\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- Jesus is sinless\n- He is Holy\n- He does the impossible\nApplication: |\n  It seemed impossible that Zechariah and Elizabeth would have a son, it seemed impossible that Mary could have a baby but God promised long ago to send us a Saviour and He fulfilled His Word. He also promised that He would send a messenger to prepare the way for Jesus. This messenger is John the Baptist. The prophets Isaiah and Malachi spoke about John (see Is. 40:3, Mal. 3:1).  I can trust God and His Word. Jesus came into Mary’s womb by the Holy Spirit and that’s why I know that Jesus is sinless. He is God and man. For God nothing is impossible. Does something seem impossible in my life? I can know for sure that for Jesus it isn’t hard. It is good to follow the example of Mary and believe God’s Word. __Jesus, I praise you and and thank you that you saved me and forgave my sin. Thank you for doing the impossible! You are amazing.__\n"}</script>

First, He created Adam: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.” v. 7. “And the Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him.”… the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adam called each living creature, that was its name…But for Adam there was not found a helper comparable to him. 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. 22 Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man. 23 And Adam said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh…” 24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.“ (v.18-25).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God is Creator\n- He is Glorious\n- He is a Wonderful Maker\n- God is communicative\n- God is our help\nApplication: |\n  God made Adam and Eve in His image. He made me in His image! What does this mean? It means that because God is the Creator, I like to create, because God is Spirit, I am spiritual, because God is the Communicator, I communicate, because God has a Reason and Feelings, I think and feel, because God is Relational, I have relationships.* People’s good characteristics can reflect God. Reason, creativity, emotions, skills, beauty, love and honesty are all from God and show us what our God is like.\n  Adam and Eve were the first people and the first husband and wife. God gives unity to a husband and wife so that they can be together as a family.\n  God is so good and gave me life (physical). It’s right that I would love Him most of all, worship Him and follow all that He says, obeying Him. He created us for fellowship with Him, which is spiritual life. Our sin separates us from fellowship with God. But through faith in Jesus, I can have fellowship with God again. This fellowship is called eternal life.  (Jn. 17:3 “And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.”). __Dear God, thank you that you gave me life! Help me to listen to you and love you. Please help me to show your love and goodness to others, that they would know how wonderful you are! Amen.__\n  Note: This is a good opportunity to ask the children if they have eternal (spiritual) life through faith in Jesus and share the gospel with them. May God save the children that you teach and give them life in Jesus!\n\n  *http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/deeper-walk/features/23549-qmade-in-the-image-of-godq\n"}</script>

For there is born to you this day... a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.”(ESV)\nSummary: |-\n  Caesar (the Roman Emperor) ordered all people to go to their hometown to be counted. That’s why Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem (and fulfilled ancient prophecy that the Saviour would be born there). Mary gave birth to Jesus there.\n  Nearby, there were shepherds watching their sheep and suddenly angels appeared in heaven and told them about the birth of the Saviour, Jesus. They found Jesus and worshipped Him. “ And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them…And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them” (Lk.2:17-18, 20).\n  Later, Joseph and Mary brought the baby Jesus to the temple. There Simeon saw Jesus and spoke about how Jesus is the Saviour. The Holy Spirit had told Simeon that he wouldn’t die until he saw the Saviour. The prophetess Anna also saw Jesus in the temple and told people that Jesus would redeem Israel (Lk. 2:38).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- Jesus is worthy of praise\n- God fulfills His Word\n- Jesus is the Gospel, the Good News\nApplication: |\n  Over and over again in this section of scripture it is written that Jesus is Saviour. This means that I’m in danger and I need to be saved. I am very glad that Jesus came from heaven to earth and became a man in order to save me. This is very good news!  I believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the Son of Man. I want to praise Him just like the angels praised Him. I want to worship Him just like the shepherd worshipped Him. I want to talk about how He is Saviour and Redeemer just like the shepherds, Simeon and Anna.  __Jesus, help me to praise you and tell everyone the good news that you saved me from sin and want to save everyone from their sin.__\n"}</script>

Satan, in the form of a snake* , deceived Eve and she ate the fruit from the forbidden tree and gave some to Adam to eat. Right away, they knew they were guilty and hid from God. They covered themselves with leaves (as clothing) but God covered their guilt with the skin of an animal.  God made them leave the garden but promised to send a Saviour through a child of a woman (3:15) .\n\n  *see Rev. 12:9\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Holy\n- God disciplines His children\n- God is Savior\n- Only God can cover and take away our sin\nApplication: |\n  God gave Adam and Eve all that they needed and warned them of the danger of disobedience. Disobedience is sin and breaks our fellowship with God. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God, they died spiritually (not physically). Eve listened to the serpent’s lie and she didn’t trust God’s words. I should not listen to the lie, if someone says that God’s Word is not true or right.\n  Adam and Eve sinned. What does this mean? Sin is when we love something or someone else more than God. Sin is a heart condition. In my own strength, I can’t love God most of all. I need help.God helped Adam and Eve when He covered them with the skin of an animal to show them that sin leads to death and that sin must be paid for with a Life. He promised them a Saviour (Gen. 3:15) and God fulfilled His promise by sending Jesus to save us. Because of Adam and Eve’s sin, all people became sinful from birth. But through faith in Jesus, I can be born again from above and Jesus gives me His righteousness. Rom. 5:19 says, “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.”  I need a Saviour, I need Jesus.  I need to ask God to forgive my sins. Jesus never sinned and so He could take the punishment for my sin upon Himself. He rose to life and so He conquered sin and death. __Thank you God for the death and resurrection of Jesus.__\n"}</script>

They followed the star and came to King Herod in order to find out in which city the Messiah was supposed to be born. They read the words of prophecy, where it is written that He would be born in Bethlehem (see Micah 5:2). They found Jesus there, worshipped Him and gave Him treasures (gold, frankincense and myrrh).\n  God warned the wise men to go home by another way. God also sent an angel to Joseph in a dream to tell him to get away to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill Jesus. They left in the night for Egypt. Herod gave an order to kill all the baby boys under 2 years old in Bethlehem because he didn’t want Jesus to be king. After Herod’s death, Joseph, Mary and Jesus returned and lived in Nazareth.\nCharacter:\n- God fulfills His Word\n- God leads us\n- God warns us\n- Jesus is King\n- He is worthy of worship\n- He is God of all the nations\nApplication: |\n  The wise men wanted to worship Jesus. They believed that He was King. God led them by the star so that they could worship Him. God led and warned the wise men and Joseph through dreams. They trusted God and followed Him.

I also can give Jesus all that is dear to me (my love, attention, obedience) because I love Him. I want to worship Jesus and show that He is the most important. The wise men traveled a long time to see Jesus. They searched for Him. I don’t need to look for Jesus (physically). When I read the Bible, I can know Him. Also, I can pray and know that He hears me.

Abel was a shepherd and Cain was a farmer. They brought offerings to God. Cain brought the fruit of the ground and Abel brought the firstborn of his flock. God was pleased with Abel’s offering but not with Cain’s offering. Cain was angry. God told him to do what was right and warned him of the sin in his heart. Cain killed his brother Abel. God required Cain to answer for his sin. Cain didn’t want to admit his wrong to God. God punished Cain and he went to live in a different place.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Holy\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God knows our hearts\n- God punishes sin\n- God is merciful\nApplication: |\n  “By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts; and through it he being dead still speaks” (Heb. 11:4). Abel trusted God and this is why God received his offering. God always looks at the heart. He sees everything. God saw that Cain’s heart was not right and that he didn’t bring his offering in faith.

Jesus helps me and frees me from the bad things in my heart. He was the perfect sacrifice for my sin. He shed His blood and now people don’t need to bring animal sacrifices to God. Jesus forgives my sin and cleanses my heart. When I love and trust God, I can love others. If I don’t love and trust God, I can’t love others. I may envy them or hate them. But Jesus is my help!

Once, Joseph, Mary, their relatives and acquaintances had all started to journey back home and thought that Jesus was somewhere with their group traveling back. They didn’t know that Jesus had stayed in the temple.  Joseph and Mary returned to Jerusalem and searched 3 days for Jesus. They found Him in the temple where He was talking with the teachers of the law. He listened to them, asked them questions and answered their questions correctly. Mary said that they were worried and had been searching for him for a long time but He said that He should be in the place that is pleasing to His Father (verse 41). They didn’t understand Him. Jesus returned home and was obedient to His parents. He grew up wise; God and people loved Him.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- God is Father\n- Jesus loves God the Father\n- God the Father loves Jesus\n- Jesus is wise\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus and the Father are one\nApplication: |\n  Jesus calls God His Father because Jesus is the Son of God. Just as children are with their parents and do what their parents tell them to do, so Jesus was in the place (the temple)  where people gathered to be with God (worship Him) and hear what He told them (study the Word). In my heart, I love God and worship Him wherever I am and not just at a church gathering place. I can read the Bible to know what God is telling me. By His Holy Spirit, Jesus helps me to follow the Word.\n  Jesus was obedient to His parents. He respected them. Jesus helps me to listen to my parents. Jesus called God His Father. This means that Jesus gives us an example of submitting to and listening to God. Jesus Himself is God but He came into the world to save us and was obedient to death, even death on the cross (see Phil. 2:5-11). __Jesus, help me to submit to and be obedient to You.__\n"}</script>

God saw that Noah loved Him and told him, that He would destroy the earth and that Noah should build an ark (a special boat). Noah was to gather 2 of each kind of animal into the ark. (7 of each kind of the clean animals). God made a covenant with Noah. Noah did all that God commanded him to do.\n  Chapter 7: Noah and his family (8 people in all) along with the animals went into the ark. God closed the door of the ark. It rained 40 days and 40 nights and water covered even the tops of the mountains. All the people and animals left on earth died.\n  Chapter 8: The ark rested on Mount Ararat. Noah waited until the waters went down and the land dried up. He sent out a raven and later a dove in order to know if they all could go out and live on land again. Then, God said that they could go out.  Noah built an altar and sacrificed to God. God liked the sacrifice. He promised that He would never flood the whole earth again (8:21).\n  Chapter 9: God showed Noah and his family a rainbow and said that the rainbow would remind them that God would never again flood the entire earth with water.\n\n  see also Heb 11:7 “By faith Noah,…prepared an ark for the saving of his household…and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.”\n\nCharacter:\n- God is powerful\n- He is Saviour\n- He is holy\n- He is always good\n- God promises good to those who love Him\n- God makes covenants\nApplication: |\n  Noah believed God and trusted Him. Just as Noah followed God, I too can follow Jesus even when others around me don’t love Him. Jesus helps me to listen to God and do what He tell me to do.  When I see a rainbow, it reminds me of how God saved Noah and his family. I can praise God for how Jesus saves me by His grace when I believe in Him.\n  God made a covenant to save Noah and his family from the flood. He made a covenant with all people to never flood the whole earth again. A covenant is a promise or an agreement. We now live in the time of the New Covenant. That means that Jesus promises to save us by grace when we believe in Him.\n  The story of the flood also reminds us that God will judge the whole earth one day. Those who believe in Jesus will be saved from God’s wrath and punishment (just like Noah’s family was saved from the flood).Believers will be with God forever!  Those who don’t believe in Jesus will be punished eternally. Noah was a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5). That means that he was telling people about God before the flood came (with words and deeds). I too can tell people about salvation in Jesus and the judgement to come to warn people. I want people to know that Jesus wants to forgive their sin and cleanse their hearts!\n"}</script>

The prophet Isaiah had said long ago that God would send John to prepare the way for people to come to Jesus for salvation. Many people came to John by the Jordan river. John told them that they should repent and start living in the way that pleased God. He also said that Jesus would come soon and would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire, and not with water. He also said that Jesus would judge people (Lk. 3:17). Jesus came to John to be baptized. The Holy Spirit came down upon Jesus in the form of a dove and God the Father said “You are my Beloved on, I am very pleased with You.” Jesus was about 30 when He began His ministry (Lk. 3:23). He is the Son of God.\nCharacter:\n- God is made up of the three persons of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)\n- Jesus fulfills the Word of God\n- God the Father loves God the Son\n- God calls us to repentance\n- God controls history\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- God is Holy\n- Jesus is Judge\nApplication: |\n  John the Baptist spoke the Word of God to people and called them to repent and told them about forgiveness from God. He told people about Jesus. Repent means to turn away from living my way and turn towards Jesus, so He can help me to live His way. When I repent and trust Jesus, He saves me and gives me His Holy Spirit. God the Holy Spirit lives in every believer and gives them strength to live God’s way. He gives believers God’s love, strength and wisdom. Like John the Baptist, I too can share the truth about Jesus and tell people that they need to repent, trust Jesus  and receive forgiveness from Him. I can warn people that Jesus will judge and punish those that don’t repent, believe and follow Him.  __Jesus, thank you for forgiving  my sins and saving me from your punishment!__\n  Jesus came to be baptized in order to show that He was given to (sanctified) God and His plan of salvation. When He went under the water, it was showing how He was going to take our sin and die for us on the cross. When He came up from the water, it was showing how He would rise from the dead. Jesus is God. God the Father loves the Son.\n  In this passage, I see the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). They are One. Every characteristic that God the Father has, God the Son and God the Spirit have also. God the Father is loving. God the Son is loving. God the Spirit is loving. God is a God of fellowship. He chose to manifest Himself to us in the Trinity, so that we would understand that He created us for fellowship with Himself and one another."}</script>

They decided to build a tower all the way up to heaven, so that they could be famous. God came down from heaven and looked at the tower.

Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” (or\n  2 Pet. 2:9 “the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations “)\nSummary: |-\n  Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. He was there for 40 days and didn’t eat. Then the devil tempted Jesus and wanted Him to prove that He is God’s Son by turning rocks into bread. Jesus answered with the Word “it is written, man will not live on bread alone but by every word of God.” Then the devil wanted Jesus to throw Himself down from a high place. Jesus again answered with the Word “it is written, do not put the Lord your God to the test.” Then the devil showed Jesus all the powers of the earth and offered to give them to Him if He would worship Him. Jesus said “get away from me Satan, because it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God alone and serve Him alone.” Then the devil left Him and angels ministered to Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is sinless\n- Jesus is always right\n- Jesus is Holy\n- Jesus is Faithful\n- Jesus is Pure\n- Jesus is greater than angels\nApplication: |\n  Jesus was tempted and never sinned. He is God. The devil tempted Jesus to 1) use His miraculous power for His own pleasure 2) wrongly apply a promise from the Bible and 3) worship the devil instead of God. Jesus responded to the devil’s temptation with the Word. It’s important for me to know God’s truth in the Bible. When I know God’s truth and ask Jesus for help, I can resist temptation. Jesus will help me to do the right thing. Jesus is my example and my help. 1 Cor. 10:13 says, “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear __it.”__\n"}</script>

He was a rich and successful person. One day, Satan came into God’s presence and God said “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? “ (1:8). God allowed Satan to bother Job.  Job lost his children, possessions and health. He said “…The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord.“ (1:21) Job’s friends came to comfort him. They sat in silence for 7 days. Job said “I know that my Redeemer lives “ (19:25-27) and he trusted that God would save him one day.  The his friends started to lecture him and said that he had sinned and that was why all these terrible things had happened to him. Job said that he hadn’t sinned and justified himself more than God (32:2). In the end, God answered Job and showed him that He is the Great Creator who has authority and wisdom and knowledge. Job repented, that is, he agreed that God was right and turned to God (42:6). God blessed Job and gave him more than he had lost earlier.\n\nCharacter:\n- God has all authority\n- God is Creator\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is merciful\n- Jesus is the Redeemer\n- Jesus will stand on the earth again\n- God gives eternal life\nApplication: |\n  When I am sick or something bad happens in my life, it doesn’t always mean that I sinned. Some bad things happen because of my disobedience but other bad things happen because we live in a sinful world where there is suffering. God allowed Satan to bother Job in order to show that Job didn’t love God just because He had blessed him with riches and success but rather because God is worthy of praise. God is with us when we suffer. Jesus came and suffered for us and understands our difficulties.  I don’t believe in Jesus because He gives me things that I like. I believe in Jesus because He is worthy. God loves me and I love Him too. I worship Him because He is God (wIse, holy, great and loving). He gives me good things (a home, clothes, food etc) but even if He doesn’t give me these things, through Jesus, He gives me things that can never be taken away: forgiveness, mercy, grace and hope etc. Also, Jesus is my Redeemer, as Job knew.

His disciples heard this and followed Jesus. Jesus asked them what they wanted. They wanted to know where He was staying. He said, “Come and see.” Andrew followed Jesus and brought his brother Simon to Jesus, saying, “we have found the Messiah!” (which means “Christ” or “anointed one”).\n  Jesus gave Simon and new name: Peter. Jesus called Philip saying, “follow Me. (v. 43). Philip invited Nathanael to follow Jesus. “We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” (v. 45). Nathanael didn’t believe that Jesus could be special because He grew up in Nazareth. But Philip repeated Jesus’ words, saying “Come and see.” When Jesus met Nathanael, He told him that he saw him sitting under a tree earlier, even though He hadn’t been with him.  Nathanael answered, “Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!” (v. 49). But Jesus answered, “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” 51 And He said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.” (v. 50-51).\n  (see Gen. 28:12, Luke 5:1-11, 6:12-16 and Mark 1:17, 2:14)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus calls people to follow  Him\n- Jesus is the Lamb of God\n- Jesus is the Messiah\n- Jesus changes people\n- Jesus is the Son of Man\n- Jesus is God’s Son and King\nApplication: |\n  Jesus invites me to follow Him. He wants me to be where He is. But how can I be where Jesus is when He is in heaven? I can’t literally follow Jesus like Andrew and John! He wants me to know Him more and more, to love others as He loves and to do what He does. He wants me to follow His example. If someone is sad, we sometimes say, “Jesus is with you. He can comfort you.” But maybe Jesus wants that person to sense God’s care, comfort and love through my friendship with them. Then, through me,  that person can understand that Jesus is near to them. Then, I am in the place where Jesus is.\n  Some people hear about Jesus through relatives or friends (for example, Andrew told his brother, Simon-Peter). Some people don’t want to get to know Jesus initially (like Nathanael). Some believe that Jesus is the Messiah, Son of God, King and the One spoken of by the prophets and Moses. From whom or where did I hear about Jesus? Have I heard that Jesus invites me to follow Him? Have I told anyone else about Jesus, so that they too could follow Him? How can I follow Jesus? Jesus wants me to know Him and to become like Him. Do I know this? As I follow Jesus, I see how He changes me. Jesus gave Simon a new name to show that He would change his character for the better. I want to follow Jesus. He helps me to read the Bible, pray to Him and do what He shows me to do. His Holy Spirit will tell me what to do and say. How can I follow Him today?\n"}</script>

And he went out, not knowing where he\n  was going. 9 By faith he dwelt in the land of promise as in a foreign country, dwelling\n  in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise; 10 for he\n  waited for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”\nSummary: |+\n  God commanded Abram to go out from his land and his father’s house to a land that He would show him. He promised to make a great nation out of Abram and bless all the nations of the earth through him.  Abram was obedient to God. He came to the land of Canaan. There God revealed Himself to Abram and promised to give that land to his descendants. Abram built an altar to the Lord. Later, when there was a famine in the land (no food), Abram went to Egypt. He was afraid that the Egyptians would kill him and take his wife, Sarai. He asked her to say that she was his sister. People took Sara anyways to the house of Pharaoh (the king of Egypt) but God guarded her and struck the household of Pharaoh because he had taken her. Pharaoh returned Sarai to Abram and asked him to leave. They went up out of Egypt.\n  In the land, there was not enough space for Abram and Lot’s herds to be together. Abram was older, but he allowed Lot to choose where he wanted to live. Lot chose a beautiful green place in the east. He decided to live near an evil group of people. God promised to bless Abram and give him land and many descendents. Abram worshiped God.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is generous\n- God blesses his people\n- God guards His people\n- God is trustworthy\n- He is worthy of worship\nApplication: |\n  God fulfilled His promise to Abraham and He fulfills His promise to me. God promised to bless all peoples of the earth through Abraham. Jesus is a descendant of Abraham and so through faith in Jesus, God blesses me. God gave Abraham land and He gives me a place in heaven with Him. __Thank you, God, that You save me when I believe in Jesus.__\n  When Abram let Lot choose the land first, he was trusting God.  I can trust God too, even when it seems that another person is getting something better than me. I can remember that knowing God is most important. It’s not worth it to chose something that looks nice but in reality is dangerous, like Lot did. Often sin looks nice but later we fall into slavery to it, like Lot did. __Jesus, thank You that You save me from sin. __\n"}</script>

Mary was also there. During the celebration, the wine ran out. Mary told the servants to do what Jesus said. He told them to fill 6 large jars with water. Then He told them to draw out the water and give it to the master of the feast to drink. The master of the feast tried it and told the groom that usually people give the good tasting wine first and then the lesser wine later but he gave them the best wine at the end.

She told people to do what Jesus said. When I see that people have a problem, I too can tell them about Jesus and tell them to listen to Him.

Abram heard about this and went out to save him. He saved him and then a priest-king named Melchizedek blessed Abram. After this God said “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward” (15:1). Abram wanted a child and God promised to give him more descendants than the stars in heaven. “And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness” (Gen. 15:6). God made a covenant with Abram. He also promised to give Abram the land where he was and said that his descendants would be in slavery there for 400 years and afterwards God would lead them out of slavery to the promised land (15:13-16).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- God is King of kings\n- God is our strength and help\n- Jesus is King and High priest\n- God is generous and giving\n- God is Most High\n- Heaven and earth belong to Him\n- God blesses those who trust Him\n- God is faithful and keeps His word\nApplication: |\n  Lot chose to live among people that didn’t love God. He ended up in a scary situation when they started to fight. I should be careful about who I spend time with. If I’m spending time with people who don’t love God, they could do some things that God doesn’t like and it could be dangerous for me.\n  Abram went to save Lot from his enemies. Jesus came to save me from sin. The priest-king named Melchizedek who blessed Abram reminds us of Jesus. Jesus is our High Priest and our King. He blesses those who love God. Melchizedek gave Abram bread and wine, which is like communion. Communion is when we remember what Jesus did for us on the cross, when He gave His body (bread symbolized His body) and shed His blood (wine symbolizes His blood). See Heb.7 to read more about Jesus and Melchizedek.\n  God promised to give Abram children and land. He believed God and God accounted it to him as righteousness. This shows me that I am not saved by good deeds but by faith in Jesus (see Rom. 4:3 and Gal. 3:6). I believe in Jesus and all that is written in the Bible.\n"}</script>

Do not make My Father’s house a house\n  of merchandise!” 17 Then His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for\n  Your house has eaten Me up.”\nSummary: |-\n  People were preparing to celebrate Passover. Jesus was in the temple in Jerusalem. He noticed that people were selling animals for the sacrifices and changing money, right in the temple. Jesus, “When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables. 16 And He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things away! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!” 17 Then His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.” (v. 15-17). (see also Ps. 69:9).\n  The leaders there wanted Jesus to show them a miracle and  prove to them that He had authority to cleanse the temple. “Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” (v.19). He was speaking of His death and resurrection. The disciples later understood what He meant. During the celebration, many people saw Jesus’ miracles and believed in Him(v. 23). “But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men, 25 and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man” (v. 24-25).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus has all authority\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- Jesus died and rose again\n- Jesus laid down his life and took it up again (Jn\n- 10:18)\n- Jesus is the temple (Eph\n- 2:19-22, 1 Pet\n- 2:5)\n- Jesus knows all hearts\n- Jesus cleanses\n- He is pure and holy\n- Jesus desires sincere worship\n- Jesus wants people to worship God\nApplication: |\n  The temple was a place to worship God. There, people prayed and brought sacrifices to God. And now, where is the temple? The Bible says that believers themselves are the temple of God because the Holy Spirit lives in them (1 Cor. 6:19). In this passage, it describes how people were selling animals in the part of the temple where the Gentiles (non-Jews) could come and worship God. Imagine that you came to a place to  pray and people there were selling food as if it were a market or supermarket! If someone was selling a cow or a sheep right next to you, would it distract you from praying? Jesus didn’t want people to bother those who were praying to God. He didn’t want the temple to become a shopping mall! What did He do? He made a whip. We don’t know how much time this took, but we see that Jesus wasn’t quick- tempered. He thought about how to cleanse the temple and drive out the animals and people. He planned what he did. Jesus always carefully plans what He does and thinks about exactly how He will do it. If He wants to “drive” something out of my life, I believe that He is doing the right thing. __Jesus, help me and cleanse me, so that nothing in my heart would hinder my close fellowship with You.__\n  Sometimes I hear Jesus’ words but I don’t understand them right away. In this passage, twice the disciples heard Jesus say something and only later understood what He was talking about. Jesus fulfilled ancient prophecy when He cleansed the temple (see Ps. 69:9). He showed them that for Him, worshiping God was important and He didn’t want anything to hinder that. What gets in the way of my worship of Jesus? How can Jesus help me, so that it won’t hinder me anymore?\n  Jesus said that His body would be “destroyed and in three days raised up again.” He died and on the 3rd day rose again, just as He said. Jesus laid down His life and took it up again. I believe that He fulfilled God’s Word. Believing in Jesus, my relationship with God changes: I can come to God and worship Him at any time in any place because His Holy Spirit is in me. __Thank you, Jesus, for the opportunity to be with you forever!__\n  Jesus didn’t trust in people and their opinion about Him. Often people’s opinions are important to me. But really, God’s opinion is what is important. The opinion of people changes and I can’t rely upon it. (Today someone wants to be my friend and the next day they don’t). I should trust Jesus. He never changes and He is faithful. It’s not important if people speak of or think well of me. It’s important that I love God and ask Him for help to love others. It’s important to remember that Jesus loves me and wants me to know His love!\n"}</script>

Sarai told Abram to take Hagar, her servant, as a second wife and to have a son through her. Hagar was pregnant with Ishmael and started to look down on Sarai. They didn’t get along and Hagar ran away. God spoke to her and said that her son would have a wild character. God promised to give her son, Ishmael, many descendants. She called God, “the God who sees”. Hagar returned to Sara.  She gave birth to Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old.\n  Chapt. 17: Later, after 13 years, God gave Abram and Sarai new names (Abraham and Sarah). He promised that they would have many descendants. He promised that Ishmael would also have many descendants and be a great people too. God promised to give Abraham the land of Canaan and told him to circumcise all the males in his household as a sign that they belong to God. He also promised to give Abraham and Sarah a child.\n  Chapt. 18: God again visited Abraham and said that He would give him and Sarah a son, Isaac. Sarah heard the news and laughed. God heard her and said that He can do anything.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is the God who sees me\n- God is caring and compassionate\n- God is generous\n- He is wise\n- God wants relationship with people\n- God gives life\n- He makes a covenant (an agreement and relationship) with people\n- God can do anything\nApplication: |\n  God wants relationship with us. When I trust Him, I show that I love Him. It is better to trust God than to try to fulfill my plans in my way like Abram and Sarai did. This story shows me how God wants to give me His promises in His time and that I need to wait for God to do what He promises.\n  Hagar called God, “the God who sees”. He knows my needs and all that is going on with me. I know that He cares for me. So when God tells me to do something, I know that it is good and right because He sees and knows everything. God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael. They are the great Arab people and today, many of them are Muslim. God saw and heard Hagar when she was having a hard time. He saw and heard Abraham and  Sarah when they were waiting for God’s promise to give them Isaac. Jesus sees and hears me when I pray to Him. Prov. 15:29 “The Lord is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.” When I believe in Jesus, He puts His righteousness on me and then I can be with God and He hears my prayers. God cares for me.\n  God promised many things to Abraham. God made a covenant with Abraham and gave him the sign of circumcision so they would understand that they are a special people that belong to God. This was a physical sign for the people. Today, God doesn’t require this. But the idea of belonging to God that circumcision demonstrated is important.  I belong to God and become His child through faith in Jesus Christ. Now the way that I live and what I value differs from the world’s values. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit to help me love God and to live His way.\n  God promised to give Abraham and Sarah a son and He fulfilled His Word. I read the promises of God in the Bible and believe that God fulfills His Word. I trust God. Abraham and Sarah waited a long time for God to fulfill His promise. Sometimes, God wants me to wait until He fulfills His promise. For example, Jesus said that He will return to take believers to be with HIm. I believe that this is the truth, but in faith, I am waiting for His return.\n"}</script>

He believed that Jesus was from God. Jesus told him that a person needs to be born from above (or born again) in order to see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus didn’t understand Jesus’ words. Jesus explained that people had already been born physically and had a body but that people still needed to be born spiritually with the help of the Holy Spirit. It was still hard for Nicodemus to understand Jesus.\n  Jesus said, “No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God”(Jn 3:13-21).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is the Light of the World\n- Jesus is Teacher\n- Jesus gives eternal life\n- Jesus is loving\n- Jesus took the punishment for sin upon Himself on the Cross\n- God loves the world\n- God judges unbelievers\nApplication: |\n  Nicodemus came to Jesus with questions. I also can ask God when I don’t understand something. Most often, Jesus answers me through the Bible. The Bible is the truth and within it are the answers to the questions about God, the world, and people.\n  Jesus shared an example from the history of Israel when the people had sinned and God told them to look at a bronze snake hanging on a pole (Num. 21:4-9). Those who looked up at the bronze snake on the pole, where their sin was judged, were saved by God. When I look to Jesus in faith, believing that He died on the cross for my sin and took my punishment upon Himself, He saves me and  gives me new life. When I believe in Jesus I am not judged by God for my sin. He conquered sin and death. He forgives my sin.\n  I know that God loves me because He sent Jesus to die for me. I want to live in the light, that is, live honestly and openly before God and not hide from Him. I want to tell people about the love of Jesus, so that they would also look to Jesus and receive salvation through faith in Him. Jesus is the only way of salvation.\n\n  see also:\n  2 Cor. 5:21“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”\n  Gal. 3:13 “Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”\n"}</script>

He heard how people were crying to Him for help and He answered. Abraham reverently asked the Lord if He would destroy the righteous along with the wicked (v.25). God said that He would spare the city, even if there were only 10 righteous people in it.\n  Chapt. 19: God send His angels to Lot’s house to save him and his family from His wrath upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Lot’s wife didn’t listen to the angel’s command to not look back while the city was being destroyed.

I know that God will punish sin and that one day He will judge all unbelievers. Those who don’t love Jesus will go to hell where there is eternal torment. I don’t want anyone to go to hell and this is why I tell people about Jesus. Only He is Savior and can forgive sin and give us a new heart.

They told John that many people who had been following John had now started following Jesus. John the Baptist said that he was glad that Jesus had come. John said that he himself was not the Christ but simply the one who prepared the way for the groom (Jesus). He said, “He must increase, but I must decrease.” (Jn. 3:30) He also said that Jesus came from above and that He is above all. He taught about Jesus, saying that those who receive Him believe that God is true (3:33).\n  When talking with the Pharisees, John explained that Jesus speaks the Word of God and that He gives the Holy Spirit without measure (v. 34). “The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand. 36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him” (3:35-36).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is the Groom of the Church\n- Jesus is above all\n- Jesus gives the Holy Spirit without measure\n- Jesus is generous\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus is Great\n- Jesus came to earth from heaven from God the Father\n- God the Father loves God the Son\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- Jesus has authority\n- God the Father gave everything into the hands of Jesus\n- Jesus gives eternal life\n- God will punish those who don’t believe in Jesus\nApplication: |\n  John the Baptist fulfilled prophecy when he spoke to people about Jesus Christ. He was humble and was ready to give Jesus glory because he believed that Jesus was greater than everyone and everything. His life pointed people to Jesus. I want my life to point people to Jesus, so that they would know that He is God, that He is greater than everything and everyone, and that they would have life in Him.\n  I believe in Jesus and know that He gives me the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a person of the Trinity and He lives in every believer. When I need help to understand something, to do something,  to live God’s way or to share about Jesus, the Holy Spirit helps me without measure! I can rely upon Jesus. It’s very important for people to believe in Jesus, to trust Him and to love HIm. I have eternal life when I believe in Jesus. Eternal life means: new relationship with God (forgiveness of sins, the filling of the Holy Spirit, reconciliation with God, Jesus’ joy and love, assurance that I belong to God and will be with Him forever). People who don’t trust Him and don’t love Jesus don’t have this life, this joy and this hope. I want to tell them about Jesus so that they would hear about how He is great and how He came to save them. __Jesus, help me by the Holy Spirit to love You and to tell people about You!

Abraham was afraid that the king would kill him and take his wife. He hid the truth that they were husband and wife. Abimelech took Sarah anyway because she was beautiful. But God protected Sarah and Abimelech didn’t touch her. God Himself told Abimelech that Sarah was Abraham’s wife. He returned her and asked him to leave his land.\n  Chapt. 21: According to God’s word, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. Ishmael mocked (made fun of) Isaac. Sarah wanted them to leave. “Now this was a very difficult thing for Abraham because of his son.But God said to Abraham, “Do not be concerned  about the boy and your slave. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, because your offspring will be traced through Isaac. But I will also make a nation of the slave’s son because he is your offspring” (v.11-13).

Sarah was in such a situation. God protected her in order to fulfill His plan and make her the mother of Isaac. God also can protect me in order to fulfill His plan for my life. Abraham was afraid of Abimelech and hid the truth. God wants me to fear Him alone and not people. I don’t need to hide anything. I can answer honestly and know that God is my help and defence!\n  Abraham sent Ishmael away. According to Gal. 4:21-31, the lives of Ishmael and Isaac teach us about living according to the flesh and living according to the Spirit. A life lived in the flesh, by my strength and works (as Ishmael’s birth was according to the flesh) can’t please God and can’t live peacefully alongside that which is from God and according to His Word (as Isaac’s birth was according to the  promise).

This was near the sea and Jesus asked Peter if He could teach from his boat. Afterwards, Jesus asked Peter to row farther from the shore and to throw his net into the deep waters. Peter said that they had worked all night to catch fish and hadn’t caught anything. However, Peter acted according to Jesus’ Words and threw his net into the deep. When he did, he caught so many fish that his boat started to sink! Peter fell on his knees before Jesus and said “go away from me Lord, for I am a sinner.” Jesus said “don’t fear, from now on you will be a fishers of men.”\n  Peter, James and John left everything and followed after Jesus. After this, Jesus spent the night in prayer with God the Father. On the next day, Jesus called the 12 disciples who would fellowship closely with Him and follow Him.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is Holy\n- Jesus is Creator\n- Jesus has authority over all of creation\n- Jesus is relational\n- Jesus is Teacher\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus calls us to follow Him\n- Jesus gives people a calling\n- He changes people\n- God the Father and God the Son fellowship with one another\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\nApplication: |\n  Jesus did a miracle when He brought many fish into the fishermen’s net. He told the fishermen that they would be fishers of men. He meant that just as fishermen catch fish and bring them to shore, now Jesus would help them to bring people to God. Now they would tell people about Jesus so that people would come out of the meaninglessness of the world and come to Jesus for Life. I also want to tell people about Jesus, so that they wouldn’t live life their own way, but would have true life in knowing Jesus. Peter and his friends left everything to follow Jesus. Following Jesus is the most important thing. Jesus calls me to be with Him always and live every day with Him, God’s way. __Jesus, help me to know you better, to love You and to follow you every day. Make me a fisher of men and use me to bring many people into your kingdom! __\n  Jesus called people to follow Him. He also calls me and others to follow Him. He promises to change us. The fisherman had caught fish, but Jesus changed them so that they started to bring people to Jesus for salvation, healing and freedom. He even gave them authority to free people from demons and heal them. Jesus also gave them a new purpose in life. I want to bring people to Jesus. He is Saviour. He also gives me His Holy Spirit to share with people about Him and to love them. He can even drive out demons and heal people using me by His Holy Spirit.\n  Matthew left his work as a tax collector, where perhaps he had stolen money from people and he immediately followed Jesus. He invited people to his home to eat and fellowship with Jesus. Maybe I have done something that is not pleasing to Jesus. He calls me to leave that old life and to follow Him. If I believe in Jesus, I desire to be with Him and fellowship with Him, like Matthew. I also want to invite people to get to know Jesus. Jesus said that he came to call sinners to repentance. I know that I am a sinner that Jesus forgave and I want others to repent too and to answer Jesus’ call to follow Him.\n  Some of the fishermen left their father to follow after Jesus (Mk. 1:20). Sometimes, Jesus wants me to leave my old work (like Matthew) or to leave my relatives (like James and John, the sons of Zebedee) and follow Him. This doesn’t mean that I shouldn’t work or shouldn’t respect my parents. It just means that first and foremost, I should always do what Jesus tells me to do. I want to follow Jesus. Jesus will never tell me to do something that contradicts God’s Word.\n"}</script>

I believe that He saves me by His grace when I believe in Jesus. God provided Abraham with the ram for the sacrifice instead of Isaac just like He provides Jesus as the sacrifice for our sin instead of me being punished for my sin. __Thank you, God, that You gave us Jesus who died in my place. I believe that Jesus’ sacrifice paid for my sin. I believe that the righteousness of Jesus is necessary for my salvation.__\n  Abraham trusted God with his son, who was precious to him. God wants us to trust Him with all that is important and valuable to us. Hebrews 11:17-19 says that Abraham was ready to sacrifice Isaac because he believed that God would raise him from the dead afterwards. I also believe that it’s good to give God whatever He asks me to give to Him. Somehow, He will bring life out of that sacrifice. Jesus died, but He rose again and now because of His death and resurrection, I have life in HIm! God has provided eternal life to me, through faith in Jesus.\n  *The teacher may want to discuss in more depth how Isaac is a picture of Christ.

But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water\n  springing up into everlasting life.”\nSummary: |\n  Jesus was passing through the region of Samaria and stopped by a well. At that time, the people living in Samaria and the Jews didn’t get along and didn’t talk with one another (v.9). The disciples went to buy something to eat. Jesus saw that a Samaritan woman came to draw water asked her to give him some water. She was surprised that he spoke to her. Jesus explained that, “13… “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” When Jesus told the woman things that He knew about her life,  she understood that Jesus spoke God’s Words and she wanted to find out about how to correctly worship God. Jesus said “22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.” The woman  knew that the Messiah would tell them what they needed to know. He said, “I who speak to you am He.” She was glad and ran to the city to tell everyone about Jesus. Many people came to meet Jesus. He was with them for 2 days and in the end, the people said to the woman, “42 Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Messiah (the Christ, the Anointed One)\n- Jesus is the Saviour of the world\n- Jesus is Life\n- Jesus knows everything\n- God is Spirit\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus gives us the Holy Spirit\n- Jesus satisfies our thirst (need)\n- God the Father is seeking those who worship Him in spirit and in truth\nApplication: |\n  Jesus came to a place where people from His area and that place usually didn’t befriend each other. He went there because He is the Saviour of the world; He loves all people and wants all people to be saved through faith in Him.  I also can go to places where perhaps people don’t want to be friends with me in order to tell them about the love of Jesus. I can tell them that Jesus is the Saviour of the world.\n  Jesus knew everything about the woman at the well. He knew that she needed the life that only Jesus can give people. He knows everything about me. He loves me and wants me to trust Him and believe that He is the Messiah and the true Saviour of the world. Do I believe that Jesus is my Saviour? Have I asked Him to forgive my sins and to help me to love Him more than anything or anyone? I can come to Jesus right now to receive salvation just like the people of Samaria came to Jesus in the story.\n  Jesus told the woman that He gives living water, so that she would never thirst again. When I have needs (for love, for wisdom, for help, for peace, for strength), I can ask Jesus and He gives me to “drink”, that is, He takes away the thirst and gives me His Spirit. He is my source of life!\n  Jesus also said to the lady, that God wants us to worship Him in spirit and in truth. He helps me to worship Him rightly.

She didn’t see Isaac, but she heard about him and agreed to be his wife. I don’t see Jesus now, but I can agree to follow Him. When I learn about Him from the Bible, I love Jesus more and more.

His way is best. Jacob didn’t wait for God’s timing and God’s way.  Jacob did things his own way and didn’t trust God in order to get what God had promised. Jacob deceived his family and hurt them by what he did. I don’t want to be tricky and try to get something from people. __God, help me to be honest. God, you see everything that is in my heart. You see everything that I do and hear everything that I say. Help me to do things your way, Jesus, even if it means waiting.__\n  Isaac was afraid of people when he was in Gerar. Sometimes I’m afraid of people. __Jesus, help me to trust You and know that You will help me. Help me to fear (revere and love) You, God.__\n  Esau didn’t think that his future and his place in the family were more important than the soup that he wanted at the moment. Do I sometimes want something “right now!” and not think about what will happen later? Later, when Jacob received the blessing from their father, Esau was sad and angry that he had been tricked but he wasn’t sad that he gave his birthright away to Jacob for that bowl of soup. He didn’t repent (see Heb 12:16b-17). To repent means to agree that I did something wrong and start to go a new direction, God’s direction. Rom.2:4 says that ”…the goodness of God leads you to repentance” When I think about how Jesus died for me, how He rose again, how He wants to forgive me and change my heart, I see His goodness and I want to repent (to turn and go God’s way). __Jesus, forgive me when I act like Jacob and try to get something in my own way. Forgive me when I act like Esau and don’t think about what is more important than what I want at the moment. Help me to go your way, Jesus and not my own way. Thank you that You give me Your Holy Spirit to help me.__\n"}</script>

Many people came and it was so crowded that there wasn’t even room near the door. Four friends brought their paralyzed friend to Jesus but they couldn’t get in the door of the house. They decided to lower their friend down through the roof of the house! Jesus saw their faith and said “son, your sins are forgiven” The spiritual leaders were also there and were offended because only God can forgive sins and they didn’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus read their minds and asked them “what is easier to say: your sins are forgiven, or stand, take up your bed and walk! but that you would know that I have authority to forgive sins…He said to the paralyzed man “stand, take up your bed and walk!” The man stood and walked and all the people were amazed and praised God saying: ”we have never seen anything like this before!”\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus does miracles\n- Jesus forgives sins\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus is merciful\nApplication: |\n  Many people wanted to hear Jesus. Do I want to hear what Jesus says to me in the Bible? Jesus, help me to know you better. The four friends knew that Jesus could help their sick friend and brought him to Jesus. I also can bring my friends to Jesus, so they would know that He forgives sins and heals their wounds, pain and sadness. He wants to help the sick. The paralyzed man needed help, but really we all need help from Jesus. We all have sinned and need Him to forgive our sin. He wants to help me because He is loving and merciful.\n  Jesus read the thoughts of the people that were with Him. He knows my thoughts and I can’t hide anything from HIm. Jesus, help me to open my heart to you, so you would teach me to love You and believe in You. Jesus forgive my sin. I believe that You are the Son of God and can do anything.\n  Jesus asked “what is easier…?” Maybe it’s easy to say that someone’s sins are forgiven because no one sees an immediate change. But when Jesus said “stand up and walk” it proved to people that He is God. Because He has authority, the man was healed and stood up. Jesus has authority to forgive sins and to heal sickness.\n"}</script>

His parents send him to his mom’s relatives who live far away. On the way there, God speaks to Jacob, showing him a ladder going from heaven to earth and promises to give Jacob the land that He promised to Abraham and to be with him. Jacob goes to live with his uncle Laban. Laban tricked Jacob into marrying his older daughter instead of the younger daughter that he promised him. Jacob marries the younger daughter too.

He promises to love me, forgive my sin, bring me to heaven to live with him, give me the Holy Spirit for wisdom, help, strength and comfort. I trust Jesus.\n  Jacob had many problems in his family because he had many wives and he was deceptive (tricky). God wants a husband to have only one wife (Gen 2:24). Jacob had many wives and because of that there was jealousy and envy in the family. God gave Jacob many children. This was the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18) and Isaac (Gen. 26:4). __Jesus, help me to be honest and help me to have good family relationships.__\n"}</script>

The Pharisees saw them and yelled at them, calling what they did “work” and “labor” and saying that they weren’t suppose to do that on the sabbath. Jesus answered, by reminding them of the time when David came to the tabernacle and ate bread that usually only the priests are allowed to eat. The priest allowed David to eat that bread. Jesus said “But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”” (Matt 12:7-8). Jesus also explained that the priests work on the Sabbath when they serve in the temple, but their service is pleasing to God. Jesus said, “the sabbath is  made for man and not the man for the sabbath….” (Mark 2:27-28).\n  A week later, on the next Sabbath, Jesus was in the synagogue (the place where people gathered to read God’s Word” and there was a man with a withered hand. The Pharisees wanted to see if Jesus would heal the man on the Sabbath. Jesus knew their thoughts. He asked “what is right to do on the Sabbath? good or evil? to save a soul or destroy it? but they were silent.” (Lk. 6:9).  Jesus healed the man’s hand but the Pharisees were angry.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Healer\n- Jesus is kind\n- Jesus has compassion\n- He is merciful\n- Jesus gives Rest\n- He saves by grace\nApplication: |\n  Jesus always does good. The day, time or circumstances don’t limit Him. Jesus always loves me and helps me. In the law, there was one day when people weren’t suppose to work. This special day is a picture for me to understand that God gives me rest. I can’t work for my salvation or try to gain more of God’s love through what I do. No! My salvation is a gift of grace from Jesus. Jesus and only Jesus is perfect and never sinned. He died and rose again and now invites me to live in His rest every day and not only on the Sabbath. Hebrews 4:9-10 says, “There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.”\n  The Pharisees believed that their rules and traditions were more important than God’s love. They didn’t receive God’s grace (undeserved kindness and help). They thought that they needed to be good for God to accept them. But no one is good enough for the Holy God to accept them. That’s why Jesus came from heaven to earth! He is good and always does good. I trust in His goodness and righteousness. He gives me His Holy Spirit to live God’s way. He changes my heart. Do I sometimes think that I can keep the rules by myself and that I’m good? __Jesus, help me to not be fooled. Only You change my heart and help me to love you and others in all I think, say and do. I rest in You Jesus because you did all the work of the Law for me. You are the Lord of the Sabbath, the Lord of my Rest.__\n"}</script>

Laban was angry but God protected Jacob. Jacob was going back to the land where his parents were and was afraid to see his brother, Esau. At night, an angel wrestled with Jacob.  God gave him a new name (Israel) and touched his hip so that it would be weak. Jacob and Esau met and they hugged each other.

Jesus, help me to be honest and not tricky like Jacob.\n  Jacob wrestled with God. He gave him a new name and touched his hip so that Jacob would never forget that God is stronger. God didn’t want Jacob to try to do things in his own strength.  Sometimes God takes away my strength so that I would depend upon His strength. Jacob started to trust God.  I can trust God.

He came to a mountain and taught them (v.1-2).\n\n  Blessedness: Jesus teaches about the character of a person who has true happiness. (v.3-12).\n  Salt and Light: Believers in Jesus are salt and light, that God would be praised (v. 13-16).\n  Jesus fulfills the law and the prophets (v. 17-20). About anger: Jesus teaches that the heart is important. He wants there to be peace and love between people (v. 21-26). The heart is important to God: to sin in thought is wrong and God doesn’t want us to sin (v. 27-30). About divorce: Jesus corrects the Pharisees’ wrong teaching about divorce (v. 31-32). About vows: God wants people to simply answer yes or now (v. 33-37). God wants people to love their enemies (v. 38-48).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is holy\n- Jesus is Teacher\n- Jesus is Savior\n- Jesus is our help\n- God reconciles us to Himself and to one another\n- God is Love\n- Jesus is King\n- God has a kingdom\n- Jesus is sinless\n- He fulfills the Law\n- God is honest\n- Jesus loves His enemies\n- The Heavenly Father is perfect\n- Jesus is my righteousness\nApplication: |\n  Jesus teaches me with His Word. I know that I can be happy only when I have a humble heart and understand that I need Jesus. The blessed person understands that he himself is low and God is great. He relies upon God and not upon himself. Knowing Jesus changes my life. By His Holy Spirit, He changes what I value, how I see myself, how I see God and the world. He gives me love for God and others.\n  He makes me salt and light. Salt makes things taste better and preserves them (keeps them from spoiling). Believers influence the world around them in a good way and in a certain way hinder evil. I want to be salt and light for Jesus. Jesus helps me to shine for Him by His Holy Spirit.\n  I believe that Jesus is sinless and only He fulfilled the whole Law because He never sinned. This is why He could die for me on the cross and pay for my sin. This is why He rose from the dead because death could not stop Him. Now Jesus is my righteousness. He did everything right. When I believe in Him, He imputes His righteousness to me. The Pharisees  had “righteousness” from their works that doesn’t save. Through faith in Jesus, I have His righteousness, which is from God! I am saved by grace!\n  His love and grace change my heart. My heart is very important to God and Jesus can change what is not right in it. Jesus helps me to reconcile with people because on the cross, He reconciled me with God. He took my sin. I can forgive others and should ask others to forgive me if I’ve offended them. When I am angry or want something that God forbids, He sees and wants me to repent and ask for help to love that which He loves. Those who don’t turn to God for help and live their own way go to hell.\n  God makes our relationships right and whole. This is why He doesn’t desire people to divorce, but wants marriage to be lifelong. God wants to give us a heart that is like His heart. This is why He wants us to answer honestly, saying simply yes or no. Jesus helps me to love God, others and even my enemies. Jesus died for me when I was still a sinner. He is my example and my help in everything.\n"}</script>

Prayer: Prayer is before God and not to show off before people. Jesus taught how to pray (v. 5-15). Fasting: keep a fast secretly and not to show off before people. It is done before the Heavenly Father. Treasures and Cares: Don’t gather treasures on earth, which are temporal, but gather treasures in heaven “for where your treasure is, there your heart is.”(v. 21). “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other.

God is my Heavenly Father who sees me always.He knows the motives of my heart. He knows if I do things out of love for Jesus and others or for my own glory. __Jesus, help me to do things before the Heavenly Father and not before people.__\n  Jesus taught that I can’t live for myself and for Him at the same time. I can’t live for riches and prestige in life and for God’s glory. God is worthy of my whole life. He cares for me today and always. He is my security. He cares for all of my needs. His kingdom is in heaven. Jesus said that I should seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and he promises that all things will be added to me. How can I seek the kingdom of heaven? The kingdom of heaven is where Jesus reigns. Jesus is most important. I want Him to be the most important in my heart. __Jesus, help me that You would always be the most important in my life. All that you do, Jesus, is right. Teach me to do what is right and pleasing to You.__\n  I can pray, read the Bible and listen to the Holy Spirit when He leads me and shows me how to follow Jesus. I can ask Jesus for help to love God and others.

Joseph sold bread to everyone. Joseph’s brothers came to buy bread. He recognized them but they didn’t recognize him. He put them all in prison for 3 days and after that kept Simeon in prison and wanted them to bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to Egypt. Joseph put the money for the bread back in his brother’s bags. When the brothers came again, they ate at Joseph’s house. He hid a cup in Benjamin’s bag and accused him of stealing it. The brothers wanted to help Benjamin. Then Joseph told them that he was their brother. They were afraid that he would punish them but Joseph forgave them. Later, all the brothers brought their father and they moved to Egypt, because there was bread there. Jacob spoke with Pharaoh. Jacob (Israel) blessed all 12 of his sons. When Jacob died, the brothers were afraid again, thinking that Joseph would punish them. But Joseph said that he trusts and respects God. He forgave his brothers.\n  See also Matt. 6:14-15 “For if you forgive people their wrongdoing,your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. 15 But if you don’t forgive people, your Father will not forgive your wrongdoing”\n  Eph. 4:32 “And be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving one another, just as God also forgave you in Christ.”\n\n  Gen. 50:25 “So Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath: “When God comes to your aid, you are to carry my bones up from here.”\n  “By faith Joseph, as he was nearing the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the Israelites and gave instructions concerning his bones.”\nCharacter:\n- God is merciful\n- Jesus forgives our sin\n- He provides\n- Jesus reconciles us with Himself and others\nApplication: |\n  I can trust God that He will work everything out for good. He forgives me and with His help, I can forgive others. __God, please forgive me for…God, show me who I need to forgive and help me to forgive them right now. __\n  Joseph had a difficult life being rejected by his brothers, living in slavery away from his family, being wrongly accused, being sent to prison, and being forgotten there. But he trusted God. He later saw that God used all these things to save many people from the famine. I can trust God in the good and bad things in my life. I know that God is with me and that He has a good plan. Joseph could have been angry at many people, but he forgave those who did wrong against him. Joseph reminds us of Jesus in many ways: He was rejected by the Jews, wrongly accused, punished although He was innocent, forgave His enemies, saved people from death.\n  Joseph tested his brother’s hearts when he put them in prison when he said that Benjamin stole the cup. Maybe he wanted to see if they would help their brother or leave him. How I act when things are hard shows God, me and others what is in my heart. __Jesus, please fill my heart with love and grace. When things are hard, help me to forgive, love and do the right thing.__\n"}</script>

Pearl: Don’t give that which is precious to those who do not value it (v.6). Ask: The Heavenly Father invites people to seek, knock and ask Him and He promises to answer (v. 7-11). Salvation and sincere faith: “ Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.” (v.12). There are 2 paths in life and only one of them leads to life. The way people live shows if they sincerely love God or not. Jesus knows the hearts of those who believe in Him.\n  Those who do what Jesus says are like a wise person who builds his house upon a rock. In times of trouble, the house stands. Those who don’t fulfill Jesus’ words are like a foolish person who builds his house upon the sand. When troubles come, the house falls (v. 12-27). Jesus finished the sermon on the mountain and people said that he taught with authority (v.28-29).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus has authority\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Judge\n- God knows all hearts\nApplication: |\n  Jesus is sinless and He has the right to judge people because He sees everything correctly. I can’t judge because I myself am a sinner and can’t see everything correctly.\n  I need to ask Jesus for wisdom, to know how to share the truth (that is, what is precious) with people. I shouldn’t throw pearls to the swine because they really will trample them. For example, Jesus didn’t answer king Herod’s questions, but was silent because He knew what was in Herod’s heart. I don’t know what is in people’s hearts, but I know that Jesus can show me what to say and how to say it to different people in order to share about salvation through faith in Him. Jesus wants me to share the truth with people but He also wants me to rely upon the leading of the Holy Spirit in how to share.\n  The Heavenly Father wants me to ask of Him, seek His will and knock, coming to be with Him. When I ask of Him, by this I am showing that I trust Him and understand that He is my help. He promises to answer! He hears my prayers. I can find Him. The Bible is full of answers and promises from God.\n  Jesus gave me the “golden rule”, that is: I should treat others the way that I want them to treat me. I want people to love me just as Jesus loves me. It then follows that I should love them just as Jesus loved them. His love is the best and the strongest. Jesus helps me to love others.\n  There are only 2 paths in life. Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the LIfe (Jn. 14:6). When I believe in Jesus, I am in the way of life. Jesus is the only way to life. That’s why it is written that the gate and the path is narrow. The other path is easy and wide, but it leads to death. __Jesus, help me to follow You and tell people that You are the path of Life!__\n  Sometimes people say that they believe, but their words and deeds don’t match up. Jesus, help me to learn from what you teach. Jesus gave the example of a tree in order to understand what a person’s life looks like. What “grows from” or comes out of a person’s life (like fruit grows on a tree or comes from a tree), shows what that person is like.\n  Jesus says that some people think that He will receive them, but they really are doing their works before people and not before God. This is why Jesus will say to them “I never knew you.” __Jesus, help me to be sincere and do everything for You and not for my own glory.__\n  I want to be wise and not only hear, but fulfill Jesus’ Words. How can I “build my house” (that is build my life) on the rock (that is on Jesus)? I can listen to God’s Word in church and read it myself. I can pray to Jesus and ask Him to lead my by the Holy Spirit each day. I can do what He teaches me to do in His Word. First I hear about something and then I do it with the help of the Holy Spirit!\n"}</script>

Pharaoh gave an order to kill every Hebrew baby boy because the Egyptians were afraid that the Hebrew people would grow strong and turn against them. The Hebrew midwives refused to kill the babies.

He asked him “Do you want to be made well?” The man answered that he couldn’t get into the pool for healing. Jesus told the man “Stand, take up your bed and walk.” The man was made well, stood, took his bed and walked! The spiritual leaders saw him and scolded him because he was walking around with his bed on the sabbath, but the healed man said that he was just doing what his Healer told him to do. He didn’t know that his Healer was Jesus. Jesus later found him and told him not to sin. The man told the spiritual leaders that Jesus had healed him. They were angry that Jesus healed on the sabbath, “but Jesus answered them: My Father has been working until now and I have been working.” (verse 17). Then they became even more angry because Jesus was calling God His Father and by this was saying that He is equal to God.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Healer\n- Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath\n- Jesus sees all hearts\n- Jesus knows everything\n- He sees everything\n- Jesus gives Life\nApplication: |\n  Jesus wanted to heal the helpless man. He is God and He came to save me and everyone because we are all helpless without Him. He knew where that man went after he was healed and found him. He knows what is in people’s hearts and that’s why He warned the man not to sin. The man was carrying his bed around and it seems like he didn’t respect the spiritual leaders. Jesus always sees me and knows everything that is in my heart. When I start to sin, He warns me through my conscience, through the Word and also through other people. He helps me to do what is right when I ask Him to help.\n  Like the Pharisees in the story, there are people who don’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus Himself said that He is God and did things that only God can do. He never sinned. He rose from the dead and He does miracles which give glory to God. Does Jesus have the first place in my life? He should be most important because He is God. He loves me very much and He is Almighty. He is worthy of my respect and love. Jesus said in Jn. 5:24 “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.”\n"}</script>

The servant was in a different place. The centurion* knew that Jesus had power and authority (v. 8). Jesus was amazed by his faith (see also Matt. 8:5-13).\n  In Luke 7:11-17, Jesus and His disciples passed a funeral. A widow’s son had died and He had compassion on her. He raised her son from the dead. People feared and praised God.\n  In Matt 8:1-4, the leper came to Jesus and said “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”\n  3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” (v.2-3)\n  In Matt.8:14-17, Jesus healed Peter’s mother-in-law. She got up and served Him. Later, many people came to Jesus and He healed them. “that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He Himself took our infirmities And bore our sicknesses.”  (v.17).\n\n  *note, the centurion was a Roman soldier, not a Jew. He was a Gentile.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus has authority\n- Jesus’ words are powerful\n- Jesus is merciful\n- Jesus is Healer\n- He has compassion\n- He is Saviour of the Jews and of all people\nApplication: |\n  People came to Jesus because  they knew that He could help. I also can ask Jesus for help. Jesus has compassion and love for those who suffer (in this passage, the widow and the leper). He wanted to help them. He also wants to help and heal me, my family and friends. I know that Jesus loves me. I can pray to Jesus and ask Him for help.\n  The centurion knew that Jesus had authority and when He said something, it would happen. He knew that Jesus didn’t need to physically be present for his servant to be healed. I don’t see Jesus with my eyes right now but I believe that He hears my prayers, He sees my needs and He is always with me. Jesus was amazed when He heard of the centurion’s faith. Jesus loves it when I trust Him and talk with Him. Our faith is precious (valuable) to Him, more than gold (1 Pet. 1:7). The centurion respected Jesus and knew that he wasn’t worthy for Jesus to come to his house. I understand that I also am not worthy of Jesus’s love, grace and forgiveness. But when I believe in Him, He says that I can come to Him at any time and at any hour with any need. Jesus helped the centurion (a non-Jew) and through this I understand that God always had a plan to save not only the Jews but all other people as well. He is pleased when we come to Him. __Jesus, I believe that You are strong, that You are God and that You love me and help me. I love You, Jesus, and thank You for Your love and care towards me.__\n  Jesus also fulfills prophecy. Long ago, God promised to send Jesus. In the gospels, I see that God fulfilled His Word through Jesus. Jesus not only healed physical diseases, but He heals the worst disease of all: sin. He took my sin upon Himself and cleanses and forgives me when I believe in Him. I am saved by His grace, by faith in Jesus.  People were amazed and praised God when Jesus healed. I also am thankful and praise God that He heals. Just like Peter’s mother-in-law, I want to show Jesus my love and thankfulness. __Thank you Jesus!__\n"}</script>

You will know that I am Yahweh your God, who delivered you from the forced\n  labor of the Egyptians.\nSummary: |-\n  God wanted to free the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Moses asked Pharaoh to let the people go, but Pharaoh didn’t want to. God did miracles through Moses and showed the Egyptians that He is the Lord (7:5).

God did miracles through Moses in order to show that He is the One and Only God and He is stronger than everyone.

She anointed His feet with expensive oil, washed them with her tears and out of thankfulness wiped His feet dry with her hair. The host, Simon the Pharisee said that Jesus shouldn’t let this woman even touch Him because she had a bad reputation in the town.\n  “And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say it.” “There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.  And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?”  Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more” (v 40-43). Jesus said that the woman loved Jesus very much because she understood how much God had forgiven her. Simon didn’t greet Jesus well into his home in comparison to this woman. “Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” (v. 47). Jesus told her that her sins were forgiven. The people were amazed that Jesus had authority to forgive sins.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus forgives sins\n- Jesus is worthy to receive worship and adoration\nApplication: |\n  Sometimes I am like Simon, who invites Jesus to be near me but I don’t really respect or love Him much. Jesus, forgive me and give me a heart that understands how much you have forgiven me, so that I would be like the woman who worshiped you out of thankfulness. It’s good to think about the price that Jesus paid for me to forgive my sin. He shed His blood. He gave His life in order to reconcile me to Himself. __Thank you Jesus! I want to respect and love you with all of my life, with all that is important and valuable to me.__\n  Jesus didn’t stop the woman from worshipping Him because He is God and is worthy to receive worship. Her heart of worship and not her bad reputation was important to Him. Jesus is worthy of my worship. The bad things that I have done before shouldn’t keep me from coming to Jesus to receive forgiveness and salvation. He wants to forgive me and give me new life in the knowledge of Him.\n  The woman was thankful to Jesus. She had sinned before but Jesus had changed her life. She anointed Jesus’ feet with precious oil and didn’t worry about the opinion of others. She simply worshiped Jesus. She demonstrated her thankfulness and didn’t hide her love. I also am thankful to Jesus for salvation and forgiveness. I also want to worship Him with my life. I love Jesus. How can I show Him my love? Am I afraid to show that I love Jesus? Why? __Jesus, I ask you to take away the fear of people and to give me freedom to worship You.__\n  Jesus knew that the Pharisees thought poorly of the woman and didn’t understand His words of forgiveness. Jesus taught Simon, so that he would understand. __Thank you Jesus that you teach me when I don’t understand or am thinking incorrectly about something.

The Feast of Tabernacles was being held in Jerusalem (see Lev. 23:33-44, esp. verses 39-44, Num. 29:12-40, Deut. 16:13-17). Jesus’ brothers didn’t believe in Him and wanted Him to go to the celebration and publicly show that He was great. But Jesus decided to secretly go to the celebration. People had different opinions about Jesus. He taught openly in the temple. People were amazed at His teaching. Jesus said that His teaching was from God. The leaders were not happy that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, but Jesus said “ Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.” (v. 24) Verses 30-31 say, “Therefore they sought to take Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come. 31 And many of the people believed in Him, and said, “When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this Man has done?”\n  “On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. 38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.” (Jn 7:37-39) See also Is. 55:1 and Rev. 21:6, 22:17. People again wanted to arrest Jesus, but no one could lay a hand on Him because His time to die on the cross had not come yet. People knew that the Messiah should come from Bethlehem, but they didn’t know that Jesus was born there.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is the Messiah\n- God sent Jesus\n- Jesus is humble\n- He has all authority\n- God does everything in His time\n- God has a plan\n- Jesus gives the Holy Spirit\n- Jesus gives life\n- Jesus changes those who believe in Him\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is the Messiah. He is the Savior who forgives my sin and gives me the Holy Spirit. I believe that Jesus has authority and I believe His Word, the Bible.\n  People had different opinions about Jesus. Some people believed in Him and others wanted to kill Him. Do I believe in Him? Maybe some people are angry with me because of my faith in Jesus. __Jesus, help me to not be afraid of their opinions but to find my strength in You to love them and to boldly live for You.__\n  Do I thirst? Just as water is needed for physical life, so Jesus is needed for spiritual life. I believe that I can come to Jesus and He will give me His Holy Spirit. His Holy Spirit changes me and will be in me forever, like a spring or fountain.\n  Jesus offers salvation to all and wants all people to come to Him, the Messiah and Savior. His Holy Spirit is within me and I also want to invite people to come to Jesus for life.\n  Rev. 22:17 “ And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” And let him who thirsts come.

The Lord will fight for\n  you; you must be quiet.”\nSummary: |-\n  In a miraculous way, God made a pathway through the sea for the people to cross over to a safe place. All of Pharaoh’s soldiers who were chasing after the Israelites drowned in the sea. God led the people with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (Ex. 13:21-22)*. In the wilderness, they wanted to eat and drink. God did miracles. He told Moses to strike a rock and water came forth for the thirst people. Every morning, He gave them “bread” (manna) from heaven. They gathered the manna every morning except for the Sabbath (for them Saturday) morning. On the Sabbath morning they rested because God gave them a double portion of manna the day before. He also sent them birds (pheasants) to eat when they wanted meat. The Israelites often complained to God and to Moses.\n\n  see also Heb. 11:29 “By faith they crossed the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do this, they were drowned.”\n\n  see also 1 Cor. 10:1-7 “Now I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, all passed through the sea, 2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 3 They all ate the same spiritual food, 4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. 5 But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.6 Now these things became examples for us, so that we will not desire evil things as they did. 7 Don’t become idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play”\n\n  Moses didn’t give you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the real bread from heaven. 33 For the bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” 34 Then they said, “Sir, give us this bread always!” 35 “I am the bread of life,” Jesus told them. “No one who comes to Me will ever be hungry, and no one who believes in Me will ever be thirsty again. 36 But as I told you, you’ve seen Me, and yet you do not believe. 37 Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never cast out. 38 For I have come down from heaven, not to do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me. 39 This is the will of Him who sent Me: that I should lose none of those He has given Me but should raise them up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of My Father: that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- He is merciful\n- ' He is wonderful (He does miracles.)'\n- He is faithful\n- God takes care of our needs\n- He is generous and gives us all that we need\n- He is our source for everything and has everything under control\n- Jesus is the Rock from which we drink\n- Jesus is the bread from heaven\nApplication: |\n  Even when it seems like there is no hope, God is strong to help and save us. It looked like the people of Israel were trapped by the sea, but God made a way and saved them! Jesus makes a way for me when there is no hope. He helps me and saves me.\n  The people complained to God because they didn’t believe that He was good or that He would help them. This grumbling and complaining was a sin but God in His mercy took care of their needs. I can ask Him for help and believe that He is good and generous and will take care of my needs. God, please forgive me when I complain about… Jesus, help me to ask for your help and trust You instead of complaining.   I can trust God knowing that He knows my needs and loves it when I turn to Him for help. God hears my prayers and He is my help. Jesus is compared to manna (bread from heaven) and the rock that Moses struck (from which water came for the people). Jesus was struck (He died on the cross) in order to give us life. The manna and the rock are pictures to reminds us that Jesus gives us spiritual life. Bread and water are necessary for physical life. Jesus is necessary for spiritual life. __Thank you Jesus, for the life I have in You!__\n\n  *lesson 32 focuses on God leading the people by the pillar of cloud and fire.\n"}</script>

He who follows Me shall not walk\n  in darkness, but have the light of life.”\nSummary: |-\n  After the celebration, Jesus taught in the temple. The leaders brought a woman to Him, who according to the Law, should die for her sin. They wanted to test and accuse Jesus. They asked Jesus what they should do with the woman. He said, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first.” (Jn. 8:7) One by one, they started to leave. Jesus turned to the woman, didn’t condemn her and said, “go and sin no more” (v. 11).\n  Jesus taught in the temple and told the leaders, “…I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.” (v. 12)  People didn’t receive Jesus’ testimony of Himself. He said that He and the Father testify of Him. He told them that soon He would go away (that is, die, rise again and ascend to heaven). He said: 1) that He is from above, 2) that those who don’t believe in Him will die in their sins, 3) that He will judge, 4) that He speaks the Words of His Father (God), 5) that He will be lifted up, 6) that He does what is pleasing to God the Father. Then many believed in Him. “Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. 32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (Jn. 8:31-32).\n  Those who didn’t believe argued with Jesus and said that they were free (not slaves) but Jesus said that they were slaves to sin and that only He, the Son of God would free them. They said that Abraham was their father and that they weren’t slaves. But Jesus said that they didn’t believe like Abraham believed and that Satan was their father. Jesus told them that they didn’t want to receive the Word of God from Him and this is why they were not of God (v. 47). They started to say mean things about Jesus. Jesus answered that those who keep His Word will not see death. They were indignant, asking if He thought He was greater than Abraham and all the prophets who died. He answered, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad” (v. 56). They asked how He could have seen Abraham. Jesus answered, “Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” (v 58)  See also  Ex. 3:14. They wanted to stone Him and He left the temple.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit\n- God is One\n- Jesus always knew that He would die and rise again\n- Jesus is the Light of the world\n- Jesus is eternal\n- Jesus is above all\n- Jesus is the Truth and knowing Him makes people free from sin\nApplication: |\n  Certain people wanted to catch Jesus when they brought the woman to Him. But He caught them. That is, He showed them that no one is sinless and can condemn another. Jesus showed mercy to the woman. Only He is sinless and can judge rightly. I deserve punishment but through faith in Jesus, I am forgiven. Jesus gives me strength by the Holy Spirit to go and sin no more. I don’t want to judge people but want to tell them about the salvation and mercy which is only found in Jesus.\n  I need light to see where I am going and to not fall. This is why I need Jesus, the Light of the Word who shows me the truth and shows me how to love God. Light also shows when something is dirty (a window for example). Jesus shows that I am sinful and He can cleanse me. I am thankful that He is my Light. I want to tell people about Him.\n  I believe that Jesus is God. I believe His Words, that I read in the Bible. Jesus says that His Word frees me. He frees me from slavery to sin and gives me eternal life.\n  Jesus is eternal. He always was in heaven, but He came down to earth and became a person. He lived a sinless life, died in my place on the cross, rose again and now He is in heaven again. When I read the stories in the Old Testament about Abraham, David, Daniel, I see that God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit were there. This is why Jesus said that He was there before Abraham. He was and is and will always be. Abraham “saw His day” means that Abraham was waiting for that Sacrifice that God prepared for sin (Gen. 22:8) and he knew that God could raise the dead (see Hebrews 11:17-18). Jesus is my sacrifice for sin. I want to tell people that Jesus can forgive their sin and give them eternal life today and forever, in the knowledge of Him.\n\n  *idea for object lesson. Talk about or show how constant exposure to light will fade the color of fabric. Constant fellowship with Jesus changes us, so that we display  His beauty in our lives.\n"}</script>

He advised Moses to set up more leaders to help serve the people. He later went back home.\n  Chapt. 19: God told Moses to invited the people to be His people. They cleansed themselves to prepare to meet with God. “On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the Lord came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.” (v.16-19). See also Heb. 12:18-24.\n  Chatp. 20: God gave the 10 commandments to the Israelites: 1) You shall have no other gods before Me 2) You shall not make for yourself a carved image…you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. 3) You shall not take the name of God in vain 4) Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy 5) honor your mother and father 6) you shall not murder 7) you shall not commit adultery 8) You shall not steal 9) You shall not bear false witness 10) You shall not covet (Ex. 20:1-17). The people were afraid and wanted God to speak to Moses and not directly to them.\n  Chapt. 21-24: God gave Moses specific laws about how the Israelites were supposed to live.\n  Moses went up to Mt.Sinai for 40 days to receive the law.\n\n  See also:\n  Gal. 3:24 “Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”\n  Gal. 5:14 “For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”\n  Hebrews 7:19 “or the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, there is the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.”\n  James 2:10  “For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.”\nCharacter:\n- God is Holy\n- God speaks to us\n- God reveals Himself to us\n- Jesus fulfills the Law\n- Jesus is God\n- He is perfect and sinless\nApplication: |\n  God has made known to me his standard of holiness through his law but I myself in my own strength cannot fulfill the law. I am guilty of breaking God’s law and that’s why I need Jesus. Jesus fulfilled the law for me and when I believe in Him, He gives me his strength to live God’s way. He took my punishment for breaking God’s law when He died on the cross. When I believe in Him, He gives me His Holy Spirit that helps me to love and follow God.  Jesus gives me His righteousness.

But He was asleep. 25 Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!” 26 But He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?” (Matt. 8:23-27)\n  When the got to the other side of the shore, they saw a demon-possessed man. The demons were afraid of Jesus and asked Him to drive them into a herd of pigs. Jesus healed the man and drove the demons into the pigs, which then ran into the sea and drowned. The people of the region were scared and asked Jesus to leave their area. The healed man wanted to go with Jesus. “However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, “Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.” 20 And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled.” (Mark 5:19-20)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus has authority over everything\n- Jesus saves\n- Jesus calms and comforts\n- Jesus heals\n- He has authority over all creation (nature and all created beings)\n- He is the Good News\n- He is kind and always does good\n- He has compassion\nApplication: |\n  When I am scared, I can call to Jesus and He will help me. Jesus is always with me and wants to help. He created everything and that’s why He has authority over everything. Everything submits to Jesus. When Jesus was on the earth, He slept (because He is 100% God and 100% human) but He was always ready to help at any moment. Now, Jesus is in heaven and never sleeps. He is even so close to those who believe in Him that you can say that He lives right in our hearts (Eph. 3:17). Do I believe in Jesus? When I am afraid, do I understand that Jesus is my help and that nothing and no one is higher than Him. If He says something, then it will be. When there our waves of worry in my heart, He can bring peace and calm. He is kind and loving towards me.\n  Have I ever been in a scary situation? I know that when I’m scared, Jesus is with me. He has everything under control and He can help. All of creation is under Jesus authority. Demons, who are fallen angels, obey Jesus and await the day when He will punish them eternally. Jesus is God. He is above everything and everyone. Just as Jesus calmed the sea and healed the demon-possessed man, He can give me peace and calm.

God gave certain people special gifts and talents, so they could make everything beautiful for God’s place and to build it well. The parts of the tabernacle are: an open gate, walls around the court, the altar for sin offerings and sacrifices, the washing basin, the lampstand, the table for bread, the incense altar, the ark of the covenant inside the Holy of Holies.\n  God also gave instructions about special clothing for the priests.\n  see also Hebrews ch. 9 & 10\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is with us\n- Jesus is God with us\n- The Holy Spirit dwells in the hearts of believers.God gives us a plan\n- God gives us gifts and abilities to fulfill His plan\n- Jesus is the Word who became flesh to dwell (to tabernacle) among  us (Jn 1:14)\nApplication: |\n  God gave the Israelites instructions to build a special place for worshiping Him the way that He showed them to.

A crowd of people followed Jesus and along the way, a certain woman who had been very sick for 12 years touched the edge of Jesus’s clothes, believing that He could heal her. She was instantly healed. He asked who touched Him but His question puzzled people because many people were crowding around and touching Jesus as they walked along the road. But He knew that the woman had touched Him with faith. She told Jesus that she had touched Him and He told her that now she was not only physically healed but that He forgave her sin.\n  Just then people came and said that Jairus’s daughter died but Jesus said to him “do not fear! Only believe!” (v. 50). At Jairus’s house, Jesus allowed only the parents and 2 of his disciples to be in the room. Jesus told the girl to get up and He raised her from the dead! She came alive! Jesus said that they should feed her and her parents were so glad. Jesus told them not to tell anyone about the miracle that He did.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life\n- Jesus is Healer\n- Jesus is Merciful and Loving\n- Jesus forgives sin\n- Jesus is humble\n- Jesus is our Help and Hope\nApplication: |\n  Jairus and the woman in the crowd both knew that Jesus could help them. Their circumstances were very difficult and doctors couldn’t help them. But for Jesus nothing is impossible. He is my hope and my help. In difficult or simple circumstances, I can turn to Jesus for help. Jesus told Jairus “do not fear, only believe!” Jesus speaks these words to me too.__ Jesus, help me to trust You and to boldly come to You for help.__\n  Jesus gave the woman physical health and the little girl physical life. But He also forgives sins and gives spiritual life. He can give me a healthy soul: a heart that loves God more than anything and anyone. He can help me to live close to Him and make me very happy in Him. Jesus didn’t boast or brag when He did miracles. He didn’t turn the attention towards Himself because He has a humble heart. When I do something good, it is Jesus who helps me to do it. He sees it and I do it for Him because I love Him. All glory to Him!\n"}</script>

When he was there, Aaron and the people decided to make a golden calf and worship it. God told Moses what the people had done. Moses came down the mountain and broke the tablets with the 10 commandments.

If so, I can ask God for forgiveness and ask His to change my heart. He can show me that this is dangerous and brings me harm. I need help from God to live the way that God’s wants.

Freely you have received, freely give.“ (Matt. 10:7-8) He told them that they would be persecuted. “But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; 20 for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.” (Matt. 10:19-20) He said that as people hate Him, so also people will hate His disciples. He told them not to fear them, but to fear God. He said that He came not to bring peace but that there would be division among people because of Him. He called people to take their cross and follow Him. “He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.” (Matt. 10:39) He promised that His disciples would receive a reward.

He wanted people to be a part of His kingdom. Jesus sent His disciples out to do what He did. Today, Jesus calls people to be a part of His kingdom. He wants to teach and help people to understand that He is Savior and King. Through me, He wants to tell people about His love and power.\n  Just as Jesus freely saved me by His grace, so I can freely help people and tell them about Jesus. He gives me His Holy Spirit so I can know what to say. He gives me boldness to not fear people, but to fear (that is, to respect and love) God. People can kill the body, but they can’t take my salvation. My physical life on earth will end one day, but eternal life in the knowledge of Jesus is forever! Some people hate Jesus, some people will hate me when I follow Jesus. Jesus Himself endured hatred from people. He understands and helps me. Jesus gave His Life to save us. He didn’t live in a palace and didn’t take money when He preached. I should be like Jesus. He is my example in all things. I don’t live for myself, but for Jesus’ glory. “ I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.” (Gal. 2:20) I find true joy in this. Jesus promises that in heaven, He will reward those who love Him and others. I show my love towards Jesus and others when I do what Jesus did (invite people to come to Him for salvation, tell them about His Kingdom, so that Jesus would become their king, and help those in need in the name of Jesus.)\n"}</script>

We observed\n  His glory, the glory as the One and Only Son from the Father full of grace and truth.”'\nSummary: |-\n  Chapt. 33-34  The Lord said that He would not go with the people into the land that He promised Abraham because they were stubborn (33:4). The people were sad. Moses set up a tent of meeting outside the camp where he would talk with God. The people saw how a pillar of cloud came down at the entrance of the tent when God spoke with Moses. Joshua, Moses’ helper, was in the tent too. Moses asked to know God and His ways. God answered: “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest” (33:14). Then Moses said, “Please, let me see Your glory.” God promised to declare His name to Moses. He told Moses to cut 2 new stone tablets for the law. When he went up to Mount Sinai, God declared His name: “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, 7 keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty…” (Ex. 34:6-7). Moses worshipped God. God said “Look, I am making a covenant. I will perform wonders in the presence of all your people that have never been done in all the earth or in any nation. All the people you live among will see the Lord’s work, for what I am doing with you is awe-inspiring” (34:10). God reminded Moses of the law. When Moses came down from talking with God, the people saw that his face shone and so he wore a veil when he spoke to the people (34:29,35).\n  The people built the Tabernacle according to all the instructions that God gave Moses on the mountain. People brought offerings to God of the different materials that were needed for building the Tabernacle. The people whom God gifted to build and weave parts of the Tabernacle did their work (36:1-7). They made the special clothes for the priests too. They set up the tabernacle, anointing every part and the priests who would serve there too. When everything was ready, a cloud covered the tabernacle so that they couldn’t even go into it. This was the glory of the Lord. God’s presence was always with the people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. “The Israelites set out whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle throughout all the stages of their journey. If the cloud was not taken up, they did not set out until the day it was taken up. For the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and there was a fire inside the cloud by night, visible to the entire house of Israel throughout all the stages of their journey” (40:36-38).\nCharacter:\n- God is loving and merciful\n- God is Holy\n- Only God is worthy of glory and worship\n- God speaks\n- God guides us\n- God is with His people in a special way\nApplication: |\n  Moses and the people of Israel wanted God to be with them and to guide them. They knew that without God, they couldn’t survive. Do I know how important it is that God would lead my life? Do I want God to be with me and to lead me? Do I want Him to plan my life? When I believe in Jesus, He is with me every day and every minute. He has a good plan for my life. He gives me His righteousness. He helps me to live His way. His Holy Spirit lives in me. God wants His people to be holy, as He is holy. Only Jesus can help me to live right. He gives me a new heart that loves God and others. God showed the people when they needed to pick up the tabernacle and move to a new place. Jesus can show me in different ways when I’m suppose to follow Him to new places.\n  Moses wanted to see God but this was impossible. God revealed His name to Moses. He is merciful, loving, very patient, and full of grace. How do I see God’s mercy, love, patience and grace towards me? Jesus showed us all these characteristics when He lived and died on the cross and rose again to life. When I read about God and Jesus in the Bible, I understand more who God is and see how He loves me. Through faith in Jesus, we can fellowship with God anywhere and anytime. One day, we will see Jesus face to face (Rev. 22:4)!  Moses’ face shone from being in the presence of God (see 2 Cor. 3:7-18). Through Jesus, we can fellowship with God at any time and in any place.\n"}</script>

When he spoke about King Herod’s unrighteous deeds, Herod put John in prison. In Luke 7:18-35, while John was in prison, he sent his disciples to Jesus in order to find out if He truly was the Messiah. Jesus answered that His works show that He is the One of whom the Old Testament prophesy spoke. Jesus then said that the prophecy about John the Baptist was fulfilled: he prepared the way to Jesus. People rejected John the Baptist as well as Jesus. Mark 6:17-29 recounts how Herod killed John the Baptist. In Luke 9:7-9, Herod doesn’t understand who Jesus is and wanted to see Him. (see also Matt. 11, Isaiah 35:5-6, 40:3, 61:1, 42:1-9).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus fulfilled prophecy\n- Jesus is the Messiah\n- God has a plan\n- Jesus heals\n- Jesus gives eternal life\n- Jesus is Savior and King\nApplication: |\n  John the Baptist wanted to know if Jesus was the Messiah. In his understanding, the Messiah should become king, judge evildoers, save from the enemy and rule in righteousness. John was imprisoned because of the ruler’s (Herod’s) unrighteousness. He wanted to know if Jesus was The Savior that they were waiting for, who would judge their enemies and rule in righteousness. Jesus answered him that all of his works showed that He fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. He fulfilled many of the prophecies and only He could. Jesus is the Long-Awaited Savior. John didn’t understand how and when God, that is Jesus, would fulfill all the promises of Scripture (the prophecies). Jesus came the first time to fulfill the Law, to die for the sins of the world and to rise again. John the Baptist even said that Jesus is “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.” (Jn. 1:29, 36) John didn’t know that Jesus will come a second time to take to Himself all believers, to judge the world and to rule forever.\n  I know that Jesus is Savior. I believe that He will return to take me to Himself, judge the world and rule forever. Now, I am waiting for His return and I want more people to know Him. I want them to be in His kingdom. I don’t want them to remain enemies of Jesus and to be punished eternally. There will always be people who don’t believe in Jesus (like Herod). These people even do evil against believers in Jesus (like Herod did to John the Baptist). But I can be sure that Jesus is the One and Only Promised Savior. I know that He blesses believers in Him and that in the end He will punish unbelievers. __Jesus, help me to tell people that you are the Promised Savior.__\n"}</script>

When the people of Israel sinned with their words or actions, God wanted them to bring different sacrifices to the tabernacle. When they did something their way instead of God’s way, the blood of the sacrifice would cover their sin. They also brought sacrifices as gifts to God (Lev. 1:10).\n\n  see also: Heb. 7:27 “He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do—first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all when He offered Himself.”\n  Heb.  9:12 “He entered the most holy place once for all, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.”\n  Heb  10:10 “By this will of God, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.”\n  1 Pet. 3:18 “For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm”\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God makes His will known\n- God requires an accounting for our behavior (intentional and unintentional sin)\n- Jesus’ blood pays for all our sin\n- Jesus is the perfect once for all sacrifice for sin\n- He is righteous\nApplication: |\n  God wanted His people to be holy, that is, separate from others. They were called to live differently than the other people on earth. They were called to love God. Their lifestyle was suppose to show others the love of God. Sin (when we don’t love God) leads to death. The blood of an animal was poured out in place of the blood of the sinner. When they saw the blood of the animal, they remembered that their sin leads to death and that they needed forgiveness from God for their sin.\n  Only Jesus can cleanse me and make me holy (sanctified, pure, clean). Only Jesus can help me to love God and live pleasing to Him. God wants me to love Him and His ways so that I would live different from the world (so my lifestyle wouldn’t be worldly) and for God (be like Jesus). Praise God that Jesus became the sacrifice for all my sins and I don’t need to bring different sacrifices and keep different rules for God to receive me. God received the sacrifice of Jesus because Jesus is fully God and fully  human. Only Jesus is sinless. Jesus, I trust You and Your righteousness. Cleanse my heart and give me love for God and others. Help me to live for You. You are Worthy. Receive my “sacrifice” of dying to my selfish desires. I want to live for your loving purposes (Rom 12:1-2, “Therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.”  2 Cor. 5:17 “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things  have come.”).\n  *Jesus is the One who fulfilled every sacrifice for us, but it’s interesting that the fellowship offering was a sacrifice for fellowship with God. When Jesus ate with His disciples before His crucifixion and gave the disciples the bread and wine as a symbol of His body (communion), He showed that He is the only sacrifice for our sin and guilt but also that He gives us fellowship with God.\n"}</script>

Jesus said that sin wasn’t the reason that he was blind, but that God wanted to be glorified through his healing. Jesus healed the man and he could see! The Pharisees wanted to know who healed him because it was the sabbath (their day of rest) and they thought that is was wrong to heal on their day of rest. The man said that Jesus healed him and that he believed that Jesus was from God because He did the miracle and helped him. The parents of the healed man were afraid of what the pharisees thought. The pharisees wanted to kick everyone who believed in Jesus out of the synagogue but the healed man said that he believed that Jesus was from God and so the pharisees kicked him out. Jesus found the man and explained to him that He is the Messiah. The healed man believed and worshipped Jesus. Jesus said that He came into the world so that people who don’t know about Him would see that He is the Messiah. But those who think that they already know everything and don’t believe in Jesus would not see that Jesus is the Messiah. They are spiritually blind. The pharisees were offended by Jesus’ words.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is the Messiah\n- Jesus is the Light of the World\n- Jesus is Healer\n- Jesus is Glorious\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\n- Jesus is powerful\nApplication: |\n  People who don’t believe that Jesus is Saviour are spiritually blind. That means that they don’t see who Jesus really is and they can’t have forgiveness from sins. Do I believe that Jesus died and rose again and that only His righteousness can pay for my sin and cleanse me from sin? When I believe in Jesus and trust Him, He makes me see Him correctly and I can be a part of God’s family. The healed man was thankful to Jesus and knew that Jesus is Saviour. Even when his parents were afraid to say the truth, he still confessed his faith in Jesus. I also can tell people that I believe in Jesus even when they don’t accept me because of it and even when my parents don’t support the truth. I can expect that some people will not accept me because of my faith in Jesus. But Jesus is always with me. I know that He is Saviour. The opinion of God is more important than the opinion of people. __Jesus, give me strength to believe You and tell people the truth that I love you and that you are my Saviour.__\n"}</script>

He gave them a list of what they could eat and what they couldn’t  eat. God wanted them to be different from the neighboring people.\n  Chapt. 16: The Day of Atonement: “This is to be a permanent statute for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month you are to practice self-denial  and do no work, both the native and the foreigner who resides among you. 30 Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the Lord. 31 It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must practice self-denial; it is a permanent statute. 32 The priest who is anointed and ordained  to serve as high priest in place of his father will make atonement. He will put on the linen garments, the holy garments, 33 and purify the most holy place. He will purify the tent of meeting and the altar and will make atonement for the priests and all the people of the assembly. 34 This is to be a permanent statute for you, to make atonement for the Israelites once a year because of all their sins.” And all this was done as the Lord commanded Moses.”(29-34).\n  Chapt. 17: The people were only supposed to bring their sacrifices to the tabernacle. God didn’t want them to eat blood (v. 14).\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God communicated His will\n- God punished sin\n- Jesus cleanses us\n- Jesus is our high priest\n- Jesus paid for our sin\n- Jesus is my  atonement\nApplication: |\n  God had special rules for his people and the priests when they wanted to draw near to Him. God didn’t receive those that came to Him differently than He instructed. He wanted people to come to Him by faith (Hab. 2:4 “…the righteous one will live by his faith”). Today, we can come to God only through faith in Jesus.  The law and all the sacrifices showed that sin needs to be paid for and that God is holy. Jesus fulfilled the entire law and He is holy. Jesus is my atonement. He paid for my sin, cleanses me, and makes me one with God.\n  Many people in the world think that they can come to God in their own way and that if they do enough good things that God will receive them. But the Bible says that God is holy and we can’t be in His presence because of our sin. That’s why God sent Jesus to live a perfect life for us and shed His blood to cleanse us. He died for me, but He rose again and now through faith in Him, I can receive forgiveness from God. Jesus redeemed me. He was the once and for all sacrifice for me (Heb. 10:10). Thank you Jesus, for your sacrifice and victory. Cleanse me. I am thankful for your love and for all that you have done for me so that I can be  holy through You and be with You forever.\n  Rom 5:10 “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life”\n  *The day of Atonement in (Lev. 16:29-34) is still practiced by the Jewish people today.

The good shepherd gives His life for the\n  sheep.”\nSummary: |-\n  Jesus spoke to the people and explained to them who He is. He talked about shepherds, their work, responsibilities and how they treat their sheep. A good shepherd will take good care of his sheep and protect them from enemies. Sheep gather into the sheep pen to rest. Jesus said that He is the door to the place of rest. Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. A shepherd speaks to his sheep that they know his voice and follow him. There are robbers that only want to hurt the sheep (v. 10). Jesus said, “I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep” (v. 11)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Good Shepherd\n- Jesus is caring\n- He is Protector\n- He is the door\n- He is Saviour\n- He speaks to His own\n- He leads His own\n- He gave His life\n- He is loving\nApplication: |\n  Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. That means that He is caring and He protects those who believe in Him. When I believe in Him, He is like my “shepherd” that leads me, speaks to me, protects me and gives me rest and cares for me. He is like a door, which means that through faith in Him I can come into God’s rest.\n  There are those who are robbers. They don’t want to care for me. Maybe someone will tell me that I don’t need to believe in Jesus for salvation. They are not telling the truth. Jesus warned me about them. Jesus gave His life for me on the cross. That’s why I know that He loves me. He rose to life on the the third day and He is alive and that’s why I know that He can protect, save and lead me. He loves me and wants me to follow Him. He speaks to me through the Bible and through my conscience (that is, the Holy Spirit speaks to my conscience). I know His voice and I want to follow Him. __Jesus, thank you that you are my Good Shepherd. Help me to hear your voice and follow You. I am glad that You take care of me.__\n  see also Ps. 23\n"}</script>

He called them to be different than the nations around them. He wanted them to be pure, kind and respect one another.\n\n  Chapt. 23: God gave the people different celebrations and instructions for them: the sabbath (v.3), Passover (v. 4-8), firstfruits (v. 9-14), feast of weeks (15-21), day of atonement (v. 26-32), feast of booths (v. 33-36). *see note below\n\n  Chapt. 25: God gave His people rules for how to live in the promised land. The 7th year was a sabbath. God wanted the land to rest in the 7th year. People shouldn’t work in the fields that year. The 50th year was the Jubilee: “Then you are to sound a trumpet loudly in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month; you will sound it throughout your land on the Day of Atonement. 10 You are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all its inhabitants. It will be your Jubilee, when each of you is to return to his property and each of you to his clan” (25:9-10).\n\n  Chapt. 26-27: God explained the blessings for obedience and the curses for disobedience. He gave instructions for when people made oaths/promises to God.\nCharacter:\n- God gives freedom and rest\n- Jesus is our rest (our sabbath)\n- Jesus is our Jubilee (the One who frees us from the debt of sin)\n- Jesus is our source of joy\n- Jesus is the fulfillment of the Law\n- Everything belongs to God\nApplication: |\n  Maybe it’s hard for me to understand all these instructions from God. I know that the Law was given to show me Jesus. The Law points to  the glorious perfect One, that is, Jesus. God really wants me to be holy and to live a holy life. But without Jesus, I can’t be holy. Jesus is my holiness. He frees me from sin and cleanses me. He gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit who lives in me and helps me to love Jesus and do what Jesus does.\n   Before Jesus, God required many sacrifices so that people would understand that sin leads to death and that everything belongs to God. Today, I know that Jesus was that sacrifice. By His perfect life and once for all sacrifice, He fulfilled the whole Law and satisfied God’s wrath against me. I’m  glad that Jesus fulfilled everything for me! Only He could!\n  Also, I see a picture of  Jesus through the different celebrations that God gave to His people. The Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee were times of release or freedom. People understood that God gave them rest and freedom. The slaves were freed and people rested from their work. This is a shadow (or picture) of Jesus. I find real freedom in Jesus. He gives my heart peace (like rest). I want to tell my friends and others that they too can find freedom and rest in Jesus. I can’t do lots of good things in order to get rest from God or earn forgiveness and grace from Him. Salvation is God’s gift of grace through faith in Jesus! This is good news!\n\n  *Jesus is the fulfillment of these celebrations:\n  23:3 The Sabbath: He is our rest. God wanted people to rest from physical labor in order to teach them that Jesus gives spiritual rest to believers in Him (Heb 4:8-11).\n  23:4-8 The Passover: He is our freedom and redemption. Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (Jn. 1:29).\n  23:9-14 The Firstfruits: He is the firstborn from the dead (1 Cor. 15:20). He is the first fruit of our salvation.\n  23:15-21 Feast of Weeks or Pentecost: He gives us a “harvest” (see Acts. 2). On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon believers in Jesus, they shared with the people about Jesus and many people were saved. All the people who became believers were like a spiritual “harvest”.\n  23:23-25 Feast of Trumpets: He is our Help. People blew the trumpets as a warning. The sound reminded them that their sin separated them from God and that they need redemption and cleansing. God wanted them to remember that only He is their help and salvation. I know that Jesus paid for my sin and cleansed me. I can warn others that they are in danger if they don’t believe in Jesus.\n  23:26-32 Day of Atonement. Jesus cleanses me from sin. He became a sacrifice for me. He is my righteousness.\n  23:33-36 Feast of Booths: He is my provision. God took care of His people when they traveled in the wilderness. They didn’t live in houses, but in tents. Every day, He gave them everything that they needed. Jesus also provides for my needs. I can remember that even though I live here (in a house or an apartment), Jesus is preparing a heavenly dwelling for me and one day, I will live there in heaven with Him!\n"}</script>

(Isaiah 42:1-5, Matt. 12:15-21)\n  Verses 22-37: Jesus healed a demon-possessed man. People thoughе, шsn’t this the Christ (Messiah)? But the Pharisees said that Jesus drove demons out with the power of demons. Jesus explained that this cannot be and taught that a person’s words come from out of their heart. Their words show what is in their hearts.\n  Verses 38-42: Some people didn’t trust Jesus and wanted to see signs. He said that He would give them the sign of His death and resurrection. Jesus gave 2 examples of Gentiles who believed in God and He warned the Jews who didn’t believe in Him about God’s judgement. He said that He is greater than Jonah (a prophet) and greater than Solomon (a wise and glorious king).\n  Verses 43-45: Jesus taught about unclean spirits that can be in unbelievers.\n  Verses 46-50: Jesus’ family wanted to talk with him. He said, “…whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.” (v. 50)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God is Judge\n- Jesus heals\n- Jesus is Teacher\n- Jesus knows all hearts\n- Jesus is Messiah\n- Jesus has authority\n- Jesus died and rose again\n- Jesus is greater than all (greater than the temple, the prophets, the kings)\n- Jesus considers those who fulfill God’s will as His brothers, sisters and mothers\n- Jesus and the Holy Spirit drive out demons\n- Jesus has a Heavenly Kingdom.\n- Jesus is greater than the temple (v. 6)\n- He is the Lord of the Sabbath (v. 8)\n- He is greater than Jonah, who led people to repentance (v. 41) and greater than Solomon,\n  the glorious wise king (v. 42)\n- He is the Messiah (v. 18-21, 23)\n- He is King of His heavenly Kingdom (v. 28)\n- He can bind the strongman (v. 29)\n- He said, “He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me\n  scatters abroad” (v. 30)\n- He justifies those who trust Him and will judge those who don’t trust Him\nApplication: |\n  What do I believe about Jesus? What I believe about Him determines my relationship before God: how I live, what is in my heart, where I will be in eternity. What I believe about Jesus determines whose control I am under (demons, the world, Jesus). It determines what kingdom I’m in now (the heavenly one (Col. 1:13) or the earthly one (Eph. 2:2) and to what family I belong (the family of God, see Matt. 12:50 or not the family of God, see Eph 2:4). What I believe about Jesus makes me either a good or bad tree. What I believe in my heart about Jesus will be visible through my words. When I believe in Jesus can I say bad things about another person? Can I tell a lie? Can I answer people rudely or impatiently? When I believe in Jesus I am like the good tree that brings good fruit. I remember the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 2:22-23).\n  When I trust Jesus, I don’t want to say something bad because Jesus’ love is in my heart. I love God and others and I can express this love in words sometimes. In the passage, people rudely accused Jesus saying that He drove out demons with demonic power. They were showing with their words that they didn’t trust Jesus. I can tell people what I believe about Jesus. I can tell them that He is great and greater than all. I can tell them about Jesus’ love and also show them the love of Jesus with my actions. Just as a tree brings forth fruit, so my life can bring God’s love to people. Jesus, help me to trust You and show people that You are greater than all.\n  Jesus came to the Jews but many of them didn’t receive Him even though He was their long-awaited Savior of whom the Law and Prophets spoke. Jesus is the Saviour of All who trust in Him. This is why Jesus gave the example of Gentiles who repented and sought God. The Ninevites at the time of Jonah responded to the call to repentance and humbled themselves before God. Jesus called the Jews to repentance but some of them didn’t want to repent. During Solomon’s time, the Queen of Sheba came from afar to see the king’s glory and seek his wisdom. People stood before Jesus and didn’t want to repent of their sins and didn’t want to hear the wisdom of Jesus, the King of the Universe. Today also, Jesus is greater than the prophet Jonah. He calls me and others to repentance. Do I want to come to Jesus to be justified, forgiven and sanctified? Today, Jesus is greater than Solomon. Jesus is a Glorious King who has all wisdom. Do I want to come to Jesus and become a part of His kingdom and receive wisdom from Him?\n  (to better understand Matt. 12:32, see John 15:26, 16:8-15 and Acts 1:8. The Holy Spirit testified of Jesus and helps believers to witness of Him. In life, each of us has an opportunities to trust Jesus as Lord and Savior. Maybe someone spoke bad things about Jesus earlier. He forgives them when they trust in Him. After death a person who has rejected the conviction of the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.)\n"}</script>

God told the people how to set up camp around the tabernacle. God explained how the Levites would serve. Only the sons of Aaron could offer sacrifices for the people. The other Levites helped to serve in the tabernacle. God required the redemption of every firstborn in Israel. God gave instructions for how Aaron’s sons should pack the tabernacle when they needed to move it. Certain Levites, the  Kohathites were allowed to carry the tabernacle (4:15).\n  Chapt. 5-6: God gave instructions for unclean people and the Nazarite vow. God gave the priests (those who helped the people to worship God) a blessing to say to the people: Num. 6:24-26 “The Lord bless you and keep you; 25 The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; 26 The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.”’\n  Chapt. 7-8: for 12 days, the priests consecrated the tabernacle so they could start to bring sacrifices to God for the people and worship Him. All the Levites were consecrated for serving in the tabernacle.\n  Chapt. 9: The children of Israel celebrated the Passover. When they set up the tabernacle, they saw God’s presence with them (15-23).  Starting from the time that the Israelites left Egypt (see Ex. 13:20-22, 40:34-38), God led His people everyday. Ex.13:21-22 says, “...the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. 22 He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people.” God’s pillar moved in order to lead them to the promised land. Sometimes the pillar was in one place for a short time and sometimes for a long time but when the pillar started to move, the people were suppose to gather their things and follow it (Num. 9:15-23).\n  Chapt. 10: God gave them instructions for how to know when they needed to move. They made 2 silver trumpets so everyone would hear the signal for when they needed to move. God led the people further (see v 11-13).\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God makes us holy in Jesus\n- He is with us and leads us\n- God provides for us\n- He is trustworthy\n- God is a God of order\n- ' God has special plans for His special people'\n- God blesses us, keeps us and gives us peace\nApplication: |\n  God shows me where to go and what to do when I ask Him to lead me. God leads me day and night and will never leave me. Jesus is always with me and leads my life. I can follow after Jesus. The Bible shows me God’s way. Jesus helps me by the Holy Spirit to follow Him. I can read the Bible to better know the character of God, His desires and His plan for my life.\n"}</script>

And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it. 6 Some fell on rock; and as soon as it sprang up, it withered away because it lacked moisture. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it. 8 But others fell on good ground, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.” When He had said these things He cried, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”9 Then His disciples asked Him, saying, “What does this parable mean?”\n  “11 “Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. 12 Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. 13 But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. 14 Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. 15 But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.” (Luke 8:4-9, 11-15)\n  The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares (Matt. 13:24-30): Both wheat and tares (weeds) are growing together in the field. They will only be separated at harvest time, when the wheat is gathered to the barn and the tares are burned.\n  The Parable of the Mustard Seed and Leaven (Matt. 13:31-36): Jesus compares the kingdom of Heaven to these things that start small and grow big.\n  Explanation of the parable of the Wheat and the Tares (Matt. 13:37-43): At the end of the ages, God will judge people and determine who are like tares and who is like wheat. Unbelievers will be in hell and those who trust Jesus will be in the Kingdom of the Father.\n  The Parable of Hidden Treasure and the Pearl (Matt. 13:44-46): The Kingdom of heaven is like that which is precious and valuable.\n  The Parable of the Dragnet (Matt. 13:47-53): The kingdom of heaven is like a net that gathers all sorts of fish and things from the sea. At the end of the ages, God’s angels will separate the good from the bad, the wicked from the just. The wicked will be thrown into eternal fire.\n  Parable of the Light (Mark 4:21-25): “For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light” (v. 22)\n  (26-34): The kingdom of God is like seed that is sown, grows and is harvested. It’s also like a mustard seed that is tiny at first and grows to be very big.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King\n- God has a Heavenly Kingdom\n- God is a Righteous Judge\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus justifies believers in HIm\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God gives spiritual growth\nApplication: |\n  God’s Word is the truth and I can believe it. The Word of God is stronger than any problem and I can trust Jesus with everything. God’s Word is more important and valuable than all riches. I can receive His Word with faith and live according to His Word. The Word speaks of Jesus, that He is the Son of God and the Son of Man (that is, He is both God and man). He is the only sinless One who fulfilled all of God’s Law on my behalf. He died on the cross and paid for my sin. He rose again and forgives the sin of those who trust Him. When I trust Him and His righteousness, He imparts His righteousness to me. This is why in these proverbs, the righteous are in the Heavenly Kingdom.God receives the righteous into His Kingdom. God prepared a fiery furnace for the unrighteous. People who don’t trust Jesus’ righteousness will be judged and will not be in God’s kingdom. Jesus reigns in the Heavenly Kingdom. I want to be in Jesus’ Kingdom. I don’t want unbelievers to be in the fiery furnace but I want to tell them about Jesus so that they would believe the Word and be in the Heavenly Kingdom. Jesus, help me to trust You and Your Word. Help me to sow the Word and share with people about You, that You are Savior and King.\n\n  Other notes on the parables: Currently there are believers and unbelievers in Church but on the Day of Judgement, only believers will be with God. God’s Kingdom grows and influences those around us.\n  The Heavenly Kingdom involves our relationship with God through faith in Jesus Christ and it is most important and valuable.\n"}</script>

Don’t be afraid of them!” or Prov. 14:26\n  “In the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence and his children have a refuge.”\nSummary: |\n  Ch. 11-12: The people complained against God and wanted meat. Moses talked with God and asked for help in leading and guiding the people.. God gave His Holy Spirit to 70 elders to help lead the people. Then God sent them pheasants but they didn’t thank God and He disciplined them. Many people died and were buried there. Moses’ brother and sister said bad things about him and envied him because God made him a leader. God was angry with them (12:9).\n  Ch. 13-14: 12 spies, one from each tribe, went to survey the promised land for 40 days. They saw that it was VERY good. God promised to lead them into the land but 10 of the spies were afraid and gave the people a bad report. The people refused to follow where God was leading them to go. Only Joshua and Caleb told the people to trust God and to go into the land. God said that now the people had to stay in the desert for 40 years and all the people who didn’t trust God would die before the rest of the people could go into the promised land. Some people decided to go into the land on their own without God’s help but they were attacked by the people of the land.\n  (see also Heb 3:7-4:1-10)\n  Ch. 15-19: God gave instructions about sacrifices. One man broke God’s law and was punished. God told the people to add tassels to their clothing in order to remember God’s law. Korah, a Levite, and other people envied the ministry of Aaron and his sons and rebelled. 250 people brought fire pans with incense  before the Lord, but God’s fire killed them. Also, God made the earth swallow up Korah and those who rebelled (16:31-34). They used the metal from the  firepans to cover the altar (16:38). God demonstrated that He chose the sons of Aaron for the priesthood. One man from each tribe brought a staff and placed it in the tabernacle. “The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, formed buds, blossomed, and produced almonds!” (17:8). God explained that the sons of Aaron (who were also Levites) ministered in the tabernacle and the other sons of Levi only served around the tabernacle. (see 18:1-3). God said that all the Levites could eat a part of the sacrifices. God gave them special instructions for cleansing (ch.19).\nCharacter:\n- God is good and only gives good gifts\n- God keeps His Word\n- God is trustworthy\n- God leads us\n- God is wise\n- God punishes sin\n- God appoints leaders\nApplication: |\n  The Bible says in Num. 11:4 that the people were craving meat. God knew that their hearts were not trusting Him. I can ask Him for help and trust Him that He will give me what I need. It’s wrong to be greedy and demand things from God because God controls everything and He lovingly cares for me. I need to ask for forgiveness when I want things to be my way and I am disrespectful towards God and others.__ Jesus, please forgive my sin and change my heart. You know my needs.__\n\n  God wanted to lead the people into a good land where they could have rest. But the people didn’t trust God. Jesus wants to give me a special kind of rest for my heart. I can trust Him. When I am afraid of people or of some new place, I can know that God is with me. If God is leading me to go there, He will help me there. When I don’t listen to God, I miss an opportunity to be with Him, to be happy.  __Jesus, help me to trust you so I won’t miss the good things that You have planned for me. __\n\n  In parts of these chapters, people envied the leaders or the ministry of others. God is wise in what ministry He gives to me and others. I can trust God and joyfully do what He has for me to do. Moses was humble and responded in humility. If I’m a leader and people are speaking bad things about me, I can trust God and not defend myself or get angry at them. If I am not happy with a leader, I can ask God for help and trust Him. Jesus is the greatest example of humility and He helps me to follow His example.\n"}</script>

You cannot serve God and mammon.”\nSummary: |-\n  The Parable of the Great Supper (14:15-24) A certain man invited many to a great supper. Those invited at the beginning didn’t come, but those invited later did.\n  Counting the Cost (14:25-33) Jesus calls people to love Him above all and calls people to count the cost of following HIm, comparing it to a person preparing to build a tower or a king preparing to go to war.\n  Salt (14:34-35): Salt is supposed to be flavorful and if it is not, it is worthless.\n  Parable of the Unjust Steward (16:1-9): A certain steward was fired and used his position before he left his job to secure his future.\n  (Luke 16:10-13), “One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much. 11 If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous wealth, who will entrust to you the true riches? 12 And if you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? 13 No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.” (ESV)\n  (Luke 16:14-18) The Pharisees loved money. God knows their hearts.\n\n  The Parable of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). The rich man lived comfortably and after death, was tormented. He wanted comfort and didn’t find it. Lazarus suffered on earth but after death, was comforted.\nCharacter:\n- God knows all hearts\n- Jesus rose from the dea\n- Jesus gives eternal life\n- God invites people to be with Him\nApplication: |\n  The Parable of the Great Supper Who was at the great supper and who wasn’t? Jesus invites many people to be with Him in heaven, but many people don’t want to come. Do I want to be with Jesus or is something more important for me?\n\n  Counting the Cost: Do I know that following Jesus means that I already don’t live for myself? Am I ready to die to my selfish ambitions in order to obtain that which is better and eternal in Jesus?\n\n  Salt: Believers should have an effect like salt (it keeps things from going bad and has a good influence). Those who don’t live for themselves but live for Jesus will be like salt. Those who say they believe Jesus but don’t follow Jesus with their lives are like tasteless salt that has no strength to keep things from going bad and no power to influence their surroundings for the better. Is my life filled with the power of the Holy Spirit? Do I have a positive influence on those around me, so that they would see the Love of Jesus through my life?\n\n  Parable of the Unjust Steward: The unjust steward did not act rightly. Jesus uses him as an example for me, so that I would use what I have wisely and think about the future. The steward in the parable worried about his future and did everything he could so that others would receive him after he was fired. I should be wise and use what God has given me (money, position in society, possessions etc) and think about how they influence my future with God. How can I use money to influence my future in eternity? Maybe I can earn money honestly, buy Bibles and give them to people. Maybe I can give money to people who are working on translating the Bible into other languages, where they don’t yet have the Word of God. __Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to use everything wisely in a way that is pleasing to You.__\n\n  Parable of the Rich man and Lazarus: My life on earth is short in comparison to eternity. God gives people opportunities and chances now  to trust Him and to be with Him after death. Even if I suffer here on earth, but love Jesus, I can know that eternal comfort and joy in heaven with Jesus await me. But people who live for riches now lose everything after death and will only receive torment for their unbelief. __Jesus, please help me to have the right attitude towards life here on earth. Help me to remember that this life isn’t the end. I don’t want to have a selfish attitude towards life and only value what I can have here now on earth, but I want to have an unselfish attitude towards life and value that which endures forever even after earthly life has finished. Jesus, I love to know You and to make You known to people. You rose from the dead and conquered sin in order to give all people eternal life in the knowledge of You!__\n"}</script>

The people wanted water and God told Moses to SPEAK to the rock for Him to give them water. But Moses was angry at the people and struck the rock (see Ex. 17:1-7). Moses didn’t rightly represent God and didn’t do what God said (v. 12). Then God told Moses that he couldn’t lead the people into the promised land. Edom didn’t allow Israel to cross through their land. Aaron died.\n  Ch. 21: Later, the people didn’t trust God and spoke against Him (v.5). He sent poisonous snakes that bit them. God told Moses to make a bronze snake and lift it up high on a pole. The people who looked at it were healed. Later, God gave them water and they sang a song “Spring up, well” (v. 17). God gave the people victory over their enemies, Sihon and Og.\n\n  see also Jn. 3:14-15 “Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, 15 so that everyone who believes in Him will have eternal life.”\nCharacter:\n- God punishes sin\n- Jesus is Savior\n- He is Healer\n- God is our help\n- He knows all hearts\n- God disciplines us as a father\n- Jesus gives forgiveness to those who ask\n- Jesus was condemned and judged for people’s sin\n- Jesus died and rose again\n- Jesus conquered sin and death\nApplication: |\n  I can talk with Jesus and know that He hears me and helps me when I need something. I need to do things God’s way and not my way. When I sin, I can look to Jesus (turn to Him) and He forgives me, heals me and changes me.\n  In this passage there are several pictures of Jesus. The Rock is a picture of Jesus. He was struck (on the cross) for me and I receive blessing and help from Him. now all that I need to do is speak with Jesus and He helps me. Jesus doesn’t need to be struck again. Striking the Rock to get water was needed only once and for all times. This demonstrates the one and only time when Jesus was struck and went to the cross so that I could receive help. Speaking to the Rock to receive water shows how the second time and everytime afterwards I can ask Jesus for help.\n  The bronze snake is also a picture of Jesus. When I look to Jesus in faith that he took my sin and punishment upon Himself, I am saved. The bronze snake on the pole was a sign that the people’s sin was judged. Jesus carried my sin and was judged in my place on the cross. 2 Cor. 5:21 “He made the One who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” I can tell people that Jesus saves and forgives. They only need to ask Jesus and turn to Him in faith! He is Savior!\n"}</script>

He who comes to\n  Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.”\nSummary: |-\n  Jesus was with His disciples and a crowd of people was following Him. They knew that He had done miracles and wanted to be with Him. He fed them miraculously, making an abundance of bread and fish from very little. All the people saw the miracle and believed that He was the Prophet that Moses had spoken of, for whom they were waiting. Then they wanted to make Jesus king, but He left. Jesus sent His disciples off in a boat and went to pray by Himself. Later, He came to them, walking on the water. Peter asked if he could come out to Him on the water and started to walk, but then was scared by the wind and started to sink, but Jesus saved HIm. All the disciples worshiped Jesus and said “truly You are the Son of God!” (v. 33)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus works miracles\n- Jesus is caring\n- Jesus is King\n- Jesus is compassionate\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- Jesus is Lord of Creation\n- Jesus is the Bread of Life\nApplication: |\n  Jesus knew people’s needs and He had a plan to help them. He knows my needs and can help me. For Jesus, nothing is impossible. Jesus provided for people’s physical needs. He also provided for their spiritual needs. Everyone needs to eat in order to live (bread in this story). But everyone also needs a relationship (friendship) with God in order to have real life. This is why Jesus said “I am the bread of Life.” I need to be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus in order to live. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and forgives my sins, He gives me new life with God.\n  Jesus took a small amount of bread and fish and fed a huge crowd of people. It doesn’t matter what I have (a little or a lot). It’s important that I give whatever I have to Jesus so that He would be praised and do that which He wants to do with what I give Him. People followed Jesus because they saw His miracles and not because they believed that He is the Son of God. Why do I follow Jesus? Do I want to get something from Him or simply be with Him because I understand that He is Savior and King and the Most Important?\n  __Jesus, help me to love You more. Thank you, Jesus that You are caring and loving. Thank you that You died for me and give me life in You when I trust You.__\n  Peter trusted Jesus and started to walk to Him on the water but then he saw the waves, he got scared and started to sink. Jesus was nearby to save Peter when he cried out to Him. I believe that when I look to Jesus and follow Him, He gives me the opportunity to do that which is impossible to do without Him. If I don’t trust Jesus, I can’t do anything miraculous and will “sink” like Peter. But Jesus is my Savior and He lifts me up when I fall. __Jesus, help me to always trust You and look to You. You are my Life. You can do all things. Be praised through my life. You are worthy!__\n"}</script>

He told Balaam to curse them. God spoke to Balaam and from the beginning told him that he could not go to curse the people. Balak asked Balaam to come a second time and promised him a lot of money. During the night, God spoke to Balaam and told him that he could go with them but he could only say what God wanted and not what he wanted. In the morning, Balaam got on his donkey and went to king Balak. The donkey saw an angel with a sword ahead and started to go around him. Balaam didn’t see the angel and got mad at his donkey. The donkey wouldn’t go forward. God opened the mouth of the donkey and it spoke to Balaam! Later, God opened Balaam’s eyes and he saw the angel with the sword in the road ahead of him. The angel warned Balaam to say only the words that God told him. King Balak asked Balaam to curse Israel 3 times when they saw them from far away. But God gave Balaam words of blessing for Israel.\n  Ch. 25-27: Israel sinned and started to worship the false gods of Balak. God punished them. It was Balaam’s idea to tempt the people (31:16). Moses counted the people and decided which tribe would get what land based upon their population. One man had all daughters and no sons. They also wanted to inherit land (usually it was given to the sons). They also received land. God told Moses that he would die soon, but He wanted to show Moses the promised land. God appointed Joshua to be leader after Moses.\n  Ch. 28-31: God gave instructions about sacrifices for different days and celebrations. People were supposed to keep their promises (see also Lev. 5:3-6). Israel fought against the Midianites. Balaam died in the battle.\n  Ch. 32: The tribes of Gad and Reuben decided to live on the east side of the Jordan river but promised to help the other tribes to fight until they all got their land. Moses remembers Israel’s journey. God wants them to kill the people that live in the promised land and destroy their false gods and places of worship to them (ch.33). Boundaries and leaders were  appointed (ch. 34). God told the Levites to live throughout the land and not in just one area. He names the cities where they will live. God also appointed cities of refuge* (ch. 35). The family of daughters who inherited the land should marry men from their tribe so that the land would remain with that tribe (ch. 36).\nCharacter:\n- God is protector\n- God controls everything\n- God is Mighty\n- God blesses His people\n- God knows our hearts\n- 'God is the true God '\n- God leads us\n- God has a plan and nothing can stop it\n- God does not lie\n- He keeps His Word (Num\n- 23:19)\nApplication: |\n  When I believe in Jesus, I belong to God and He is my help and defence (protection). Sometimes, people who don’t love God want to show that they are strong and they try to make us lower than they are. I can trust Jesus and know that He is my help and defence. He takes care of me and He sees everything that people do. Also, it’s important to not be like Balaam. He wanted to do things just to get money. He didn’t love God. Instead, he loved glory from people.\n  Look again at Numbers 24:17 “I see him, but not now; I perceive him, but not near. A star will come from Jacob, and a scepter will arise from Israel.” Do you know who this is talking about? Jesus!\n  *Ch. 35 talks about cities of refuge. This is another picture of Jesus. I can “run” to Him for salvation from sin even though I deserve death. People then had to live in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. Only then were they free to leave the city (v.25). But Jesus is my high priest who already died (and rose again!). I am free from punishment for sin through faith in Jesus.\n"}</script>

He answered that He would give them the sign of Jonah. Jesus warned His disciples about the “leaven” (teaching) of the Pharisees. They didn’t understand and thought that Jesus was talking about bread, which they had forgotten to take with them.

His death and resurrection would show those who wanted to test Him that He is God. Do I trust Jesus or do I want to test Him? Through His sinless life on earth, His death and resurrection, He has proven that He alone is God and Savior.\n  Jesus warned His disciples about the teaching of the Pharisees. What was wrong with their teaching?\n  1) They honored the opinion of people more than the opinion of God\n  2) They wanted to test and not trust God\n  3) They trusted their own “righteousness” and not the righteousness of Jesus.\n  __Jesus, help me to trust and honor Your ways more than any other, to trust You and Your righteousness.__\n"}</script>

Moses talked about how the people should obey God and not worship idols.\n  Ch. 9-11: God reminded them that He is not giving them the land because they are righteous (9:6-7). He reminded them about how they worshipped the golden calf. God wants His people to love Him and to give their hearts to Him (10:12-17). God wants them to love Him (11:13). When they enter the land, they should read the blessings for obedience on one mountain and the curses for disobedience on another mountain (11:29).\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- He is generous\n- Jesus is The Prophet (Deut\n- 18:15-22)\n- God blesses\n- God punishes sin\n- God fulfills His Word\n- God loves His people\n- God warns about the consequences of sin\n- God tests people (Deut\n- 8:2)\nApplication: |\n  In Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the law and reminds people of what God did and said to them. There is a saying “repetition is the mother of learning.” It’s useful for me to read God’s Word and remember: what God tells me, what Jesus did for me, how He provides for and cares for me, what He promises me, why it’s dangerous to forget about God. I can ask Jesus to help me to read the Bible and remember what I read. He helps me to be obedient to God. He gives me His Holy Spirit that gives me strength to follow Jesus and trust Him. He helps me to love God and others.\n  God chose Israel to be His special people and He loves them (Deut. 4:37, 7:6-7,10:15).  God also loves me and desires me to know His love and to love Him. He is worthy! Jesus, help me to love you more and more and to trust you and your Word. Your Word says, “…man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord” (Deut. 8:3). Jesus quoted this verse  when He was tempted (see Luke 4).\n  In Deut. 18:15-22, God speaks about Jesus as the Prophet that the people should listen to. This is one of the many OT prophecies about Jesus. People waited many years for God to send the Messiah, Jesus. We know that He accomplished His saving work. __Jesus, help us to tell others about your great love and victory!__\n"}</script>

Peter correctly said that Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus told the disciples how He would soon be killed in Jerusalem and on the third day, rise. Peter didn’t agree and Jesus said ”Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.” (v.23) Jesus explained what it means to follow Him and that He will return one day with angels to judge the world and rule in His kingdom.\n  17:1-13: Jesus and three of His disciples climbed a mountain and there Jesus was transfigured and shone very brightly. Moses and Elijah appeared and talked with Him. The disciples heard a voice from heaven saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!” (v. 5) They were afraid. They asked Jesus about the prophecy which says that Elijah should come first. Jesus answered that Elijah would and has come. They understood that Jesus was speaking of John the Baptist.\n  In verses 14-21, the disciples couldn’t heal a boy, but Jesus healed him. They asked why they couldn’t heal him. Jesus said, “Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.” (20-21)\n  In verses 22-23 Jesus again spoke of His death and resurrection on the third day.\n  In verses 24-27, people asked Jesus to pay the temple tax. He said that the kings’ sons are free from paying taxes and then told Peter to go catch a fish, find money in the fish’s mouth, and to pay the tax for Peter and Himself .\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is eternal\n- Jesus fulfills prophecy\n- Jesus is Healer\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus knew that He would lay down His life at the cross and rise again on the third\n  day\nApplication: |\n  Jesus told the disciples in advance about His death and resurrection. He knew that He came to the world to give His life, to pay for my sin and the sin of all people. His transfiguration on the mountain and conversation with Moses and Elijah show me that Jesus is the Son of God, that He is eternal and that He fulfills the words of the Law (given by God through Moses) and prophecy (which Elijah represented). God’s plan to save humanity was from eternity. It was always His plan for me to know Him as my God and Savior. I want to tell everyone that Jesus is the Son of God who died for our sin and rose on the third day to forgive us and give us life in the knowledge of Him. I trust Jesus.\n"}</script>

Cleansing for unsolved murders. “Cursed is anyone who hangs on a tree” (21:23). Laws about safety, purity and honesty. Laws about caring for the poor during harvest time (24:19-22). Instructions about thanksgiving and prayer to God for the firstfruits (ch. 26).\n  Ch. 27-28: The words of blessing for obedience and the consequences for disobedience that they were to write and read on Mount Ebal, once they entered the land. God told them in detail what would happen to the people when they stopped trusting Him.\n  Ch. 29-30: Instructions to follow after God. “Be sure there is no man, woman, clan, or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the Lord our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Be sure there is no root among you bearing poisonous and bitter fruit. 19 When someone hears the words of this oath, he may consider himself exempt, thinking, ‘I will have peace even though I follow my own stubborn heart.’ This will lead to the destruction of the well-watered land as well as the dry land” (29:18-19). God curses those who disobey but promises to forgive those who repent and return to Him. “I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life so that you and your descendants may live, 20 love the Lord your God, obey Him, and remain faithful to Him. For He is your life, and He will prolong your life in the land the Lord swore to give to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” (30:19-20).\n  Ch. 31-34: Joshua  would lead the people into the land. God again and again tells the people to be brave and to not fear because He is with them. The people are instructed to read the Law together every 7 years. Moses taught the people a song that includes their history, warnings and the character of God. God told Moses that He would die soon and that He would show him the land.

He died and Israel mourned him.\n\n  Ps. 90 A prayer of Moses. v. 1 “Lord, You have been our refuge in every generation. 2 Before the mountains were born, before You gave birth to the earth and the world, from eternity to eternity, You are God.”\nCharacter:\n- God is with us\n- God leads His people\n- God fulfills His Word\n- God knows everything ahead of time\nApplication: |\n  Often in Deuteronomy, God tells the people to love Him. He also repeats that He loves them, that He chose them, that He leads them and that He is with them. I know that God loves me. He chose me and leads me and is always with me. God warns that it is dangerous to not trust Him.\n  Jesus, help me to trust You and follow after You.\n  Just like Moses, people die, but I am confident that I will be with God because I believe in Jesus. God gave Joshua a job to lead the people. He wants me to be brave and courageous and to trust Him just like Joshua.\n  The people of Israel were ready to enter the promised land. Maybe they were scared because they didn’t know what was ahead. God comforted them and told them that a blessing was waiting for them. Jesus wants me to trust Him. He wants to lead my life. Maybe I don’t know exactly what is ahead, but I know that Jesus is faithful and that He loves me. I can trust Him. I want to follow Him.\n"}</script>

He said that a greater punishment awaits those who lead them astray.\n  In verses 7-9, He taught that people need to get rid of all that leads them to sin.\n  Verses 10-14 say, ““Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. 11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost. 12 “What do you think?

Jesus guards me. Jesus came to earth to save me and all people. Without Jesus, I am like a lost sheep, who got lost in the mountains. Without Jesus’ help, I will perish. But He seeks me and wants me to be a part of his flock so that He can take care of me forever. How does He seek me? When I hear stories about Jesus, when I hear songs about Jesus, when people talk about Jesus, that is when He is calling me to Himself. Through all those things, He reveals Himself to me, so that I would come to Him. When I believe in Jesus, then He received me into His Kingdom, where there is joy, peace and love. I can tell others about Jesus so that they would come to Him and know that Jesus is Savior. Maybe they don’t know that life without Jesus is very dangerous. I can tell them that Jesus wants to care for them, forgive their sin and receive them into His Heavenly Kingdom. Jesus, help me to tell my friends, relatives and neighbors that You want to and are able to save them. This is Your will, that people would not perish (see John 3:16).\n  In verses 21-35, Jesus taught that if I don’t forgive another person’s sin, that means that I don’t understand His forgiveness towards me. __Jesus, help me to forgive those who sin against me because You have forgiven me! Give me strength to forgive. Give me a humble heart that understands Your Great Love. You laid down your life for me, Jesus, even though I deserve punishment. Thank you for Your forgiveness.

For then you will prosper and succeed in whatever you do.”\nSummary: |\n  The 40 years of punishment were finished. Moses had died. Joshua is the leader of Israel. God told him again and again not to fear, to be obedient and to take the land. God promises to be with him. God told the people to go into the promised land. A new group of spies went into the land and hid in the house of Rahab, in the city of Jericho. Rahab heard about God and believed that He is mighty. The spies promised to save her and her family if she would hang a red cord in her window, so they could remember which house was hers.\n  The Israelites were ready to cross over into the promised land and God told them to cross the Jordan river. God promised to stop the water when they stepped into the river so that they could safely cross over to the other side. And God did it! The people set up stones to remember what God did there.\n  God tells the new generation to be circumcised according to the law. The people celebrate Passover. They eat food from the land and stopped receiving manna.  Joshua meets the commander of the Lord’s army who tells him how to conquer the city.\n  Jericho was a huge city with big thick walls. God told the people to silently march around the city of Jericho once for 6 days and on the 7th day to march around the city 7 times and then to blow their trumpets. Then the walls around the city of Jericho came falling down!  God gave the city to the Israelites and the people saw that God is great and mighty. Rahab and her family were saved out of the city because she hung the red cord in her window.\n\n  see also Heb 11:30-31 “By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after being encircled by the Israelites for seven days. 31 By faith Rahab the prostitute received the spies in peace and didn’t perish with those who disobeyed.”\nCharacter:\n- God is powerful! God keeps His promises\n- God saves those who believe in Him\n- God can do the impossible\n- God is the strongest! Nothing and no one is stronger than God\n- Jesus is the commander of the Lord’s army\nApplication: |\n  God told the people to do something that seemed impossible. Jericho was a huge city with big thick walls but God was stronger than the walls! Even when something seems impossible, I know that with God nothing is impossible. I believe that God is powerful.  Rahab believed in God and put the red cord in her window. The red cord reminds me of the blood over the windows at Passover and of Jesus’ blood. Just as God saved Rahab, He saves me when I believe that Jesus’ paid for my sin with His blood.\n  Jesus is eternal and sometimes we read about Him in the Old Testament. Jesus is the commander of the Lord’s army. I believe that He will return to take believers to be with Him and to judge and punish the sinful world. I want to tell people about Jesus so that they would trust Him and not be judged by God. Jesus is mighty to save!\n"}</script>

In verses 13-15, Jesus blesses the children. In verses 16-30, the rich young ruler asked Jesus how to inherit eternal life (see Luke 18:18 and 23). Jesus taught that those who leave everything and follow Him inherit eternal life.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King\n- Jesus wants people (children) to come to Him\n- God makes families whole\n- Jesus has an eternal kingdom\nApplication: |\n  Jesus wants me to come to Him.

I can be in His kingdom when I trust Him. Being in His kingdom means that I follow Him, my King. He is the most important and I want to do what pleases Him because I love Him.

Then when the people went to fight against another city, Ai, they didn’t win. Joshua sought the Lord and God told him that they were struck because of sin. The people found the man who sinned and punished him. Then the people fought against Ai and that time, God allowed them to take treasures.\n  Ch. 9 The people of Gibeon tricked the Israelites. They were afraid that Israel would destroy them and so they tricked them into making a peace treaty with them. The Israelites didn’t ask God for advice before they made the treaty. God wanted to protect the people from being bound to people who didn’t love God. Now God wanted the people to keep their word and not break their promise, but fight and defend the people of Gibeon.\n  The people fought against 5 kings; Joshua asked God to stop the sun in the sky during the battle. God did it and the people won. The people continued to fight against many cities. God gave them victory, just as He promised.\nCharacter:\n- God is wise\n- God tells us what to do\n- God is good\n- God keeps His promises\nApplication: |\n  It’s very important for me to listen to God. Sometimes I want something and God tells me not to take it, just like He forbid the people to take the treasures from Jericho. He knows what is good for me and what is harmful for me. If God tells me not to do something, I am confident that He has something better for me later.\n  I need to ask God to give me wisdom to make decisions according to His will and not rush, like the people did when they made a treaty with unbelievers. I know that He will answer me when I seek to know His opinion. I can read the Bible and know what God wants and how to live. God can help me to keep my promises and act how Jesus wants me to act.\n  God promised to give the people the land and He even stopped the sun, to give them success! For God, nothing is impossible. I trust Jesus.\n\n  *there are various legends in different cultures around the world that talk about a long day or a long night. They have these legends because of the day that God stopped the sun.

He who\n  believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.”\nSummary: |\n  Jesus heard that His friend Lazarus was sick and died. Jesus purposely didn’t come to Lazarus before he died because his sickness was for the glory of God (v. 4). Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha. Martha believed in Jesus and knew that He could do anything but she didn’t know if it was God’s will to raise Lazarus from the dead. Jesus told her that He is the Resurrection and the Life. Many people were with Mary and Martha to comfort them. Mary came to Jesus and said that Jesus could have prevented her brother’s death. Jesus saw how the sisters and others were crying about Lazarus’s death. He also cried (v. 35). Jesus went to the grave where Lazarus lay and asked them to remove the stone. Martha warned that there would be a bad smell because Lazarus had already been dead for 4 days. “Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” (v.40). Jesus said in a loud voice “Lazarus, come out!” (v.43) and Lazarus come out of the grave! Many people saw this miracle.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is almighty\n- He knows everything\n- He is wise\n- He is the Resurrection and the Life\n- He had authority over death\n- He is loving\n- He is compassionate\n- Jesus is our Hope\nApplication: |\n  Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. He Himself rose from the dead. He also promises to raise me up after death (if I die before His Second Coming). This is why He said to Martha, “I am the Resurrection and the Life, he who believes in me though he may die, he shall live.” When believers in Jesus die, they have a hope that they will live again with Jesus in His Eternal Kingdom. If I have a friend or a relative who died, knowing Jesus, I will see them again. Jesus will raise up all people. Those who believe in Him will live forever, happy in paradise. Those who don’t believe in Him will be forever tormented in hell. This is why it is important to believe in Jesus! This is why it is important to tell people that Jesus gives eternal life. I don’t want to go to hell and don’t want anyone else to go there either.\n  Also, in this story, I see that Jesus loved His friends and He was sad when they were having a hard time. He sees how the world has sin, sickness and death and how people suffer from this. He came to earth to conquer sin and death. Today, people still die but through faith in Jesus, there is the hope of resurrection and eternal life. I don’t have to fear death because for believers in Jesus, death is just crossing over into God’s presence.\n  Just like with Lazarus, sometimes Jesus decides not to heal someone now and allows them to die. But this doesn’t mean that He doesn’t love the person. Believers will be with Jesus after death and Jesus in His wisdom knows when to take someone to be with Him in heaven. I can trust Jesus and know that He is wise and has good plans for me and other believers. __Jesus, you are my Hope!__\n"}</script>

As\n  for me and my family, we will worship Yahweh.”\nSummary: |\n  God told Joshua that he was old and that there was still much land to be taken. He wrote where each tribe should live. The tribes of Gad and Manasseh settled on the eastern side of the Jordan river. The tribe of Levi didn’t inherit land, but was scattered in different cities throughout the territory of Israel. God told them that He was their inheritance (13:33). Caleb was one of the spies that Moses sent to scout out the land 40 years earlier. Only he and Joshua trusted God and told the people to enter the land, as God said. At that time,  God had promised that Caleb and Joshua would go into the land and receive their inheritance. Now Caleb was 85 years old but God gave him strength to fight for his land and he lived there. When the tribes fought for the land, they didn’t completely drive out the Canaanites from their cities.\n  Ch. 18-19: Seven of the tribes still hadn’t fought for their land. Joshua commanded them to fight (18:3). Joshua lived in his inheritance. The tabernacle was in Shiloh.\n  Ch. 20-21: A list of the cities of refuge. The list of the cities for the Levites.\n  Ch. 22: The tribes on the eastern side of the Jordan river went home after taking the land. Joshua told them to love God and follow Him. They returned and made an altar. Other tribes saw this, didn’t understand and wanted to fight against them. They thought that the eastern tribes started to worship God their own way, and not according to the law. They asked them why they built the altar. They answered that they simply wanted to remember what God had done in order to teach their children to follow God. They wanted the altar to be a witness. They knew that they were only supposed to bring sacrifices to God’s altar at the tabernacle (in Shiloh). The other tribes understood and went home in peace.\n  Ch. 23-24: Joshua knew that he would die soon and spoke to the people about God’s faithfulness. He told them to love God (23:11) and warned them that they wouldn’t continue to live in the land if they didn’t follow God (23:16). He gathered the people and reminded them of the people’s history and all that God had done for them. He wanted the people to chose to follow God and said “But if it doesn’t please you to worship Yahweh, choose for yourselves today the one you will worship: the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the Euphrates River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my family, we will worship Yahweh” (24:15). The people made a covenant that they would follow God. Then Joshua died. “Israel worshiped Yahweh throughout Joshua’s lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had experienced all the works Yahweh had done for Israel” (24:31).\n  “Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the parcel of land Jacob had purchased… It was an inheritance for Joseph’s descendants” (24:32). See also Heb. 11:25.\nCharacter:\n- God fulfills His Word\n- He is Mighty\n- God warns\n- God blesses those who trust Him\n- God gives strength to fulfill His Word\n- God is worthy to be obeyed\n- God is worthy of love\nApplication: |\n  God said that He would give people the land and He kept His Word. He even gave “grandpa” Caleb strength to fight for his land! God helps me and gives me strength to fulfill His Word and be obedient to Him. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit so I can love God and follow after Him.\n  Through the Bible, God shows me how to follow Him. I read His promises to me in the Bible and believe that He fulfills His Word. For example, the Bible says that in Jesus, sin no longer controls me (Rom. 6:6).  Just as God helped Israel to drive the enemies out of the land, so also Jesus helps me to drive sin and every bad habit and thought out of my heart, so that I can love God. Also, as God gave the people the land, where they could live, Jesus promises to prepare a place for me in heaven, so that I can live with Him forever.\n  Joshua told the people to love God and to follow Him. God warns the people that it will be very hard for them and that they won’t live in the land if they start to live their own way. __Jesus Christ, help me to love you and follow you. Help me to chose to follow You for my whole life. Jesus, only in You is there full life and joy!__\n"}</script>

They all received the same wages at the end of the day, regardless of how many hours they worked.\n  In verses 17-19, Jesus said that He would lay down His life in Jerusalem and on the third day rise.\n  In verses 20-28, The mother of the sons of Zebedee asked Jesus to give her sons a good position in His kingdom. Jesus explained that God the Father chooses who will be where in the kingdom. Jesus said that in the world, people like to have authority over others,  “Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. 27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave— 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (v. 26-28).\n  In verses 29-34, Jesus healed two blind men on the road.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- Jesus has a heavenly kingdom\n- Jesus is Healer\nApplication: |\n  Jesus teaches me through His parable that He saves by grace. He teaches that the first will be last and the last will be first. That is, people who first heard about salvation in Jesus (the Jews) and people who heard about salvation in Jesus last (the Gentiles) received the same from the master (God). I am saved by grace through faith in Jesus. After the parable, Jesus reminded the disciples that He would die and rise again in Jerusalem. He wants me to understand how He saves us. I don’t deserve anything, but He gave His life for me and redeemed me so that I could be in His kingdom.\n  The mother of James and John thought that Jesus’ kingdom would be like an earthly kingdom, only better. She and the disciples didn’t understand that the heavenly kingdom isn’t like an earthly government. Jesus came to serve us, became a servant and laid down His life. And yet, He is the King of His Kingdom! He is the Servant King. Jesus, help me to follow Your example of love. Jesus showed mercy to the blind men that He healed on the road.\n  I shouldn’t think about how much I do for Jesus and how much I “should” get from Him. This is a wrong understanding of God’s kingdom. I am thankful for His grace and mercy towards me, that I can be a part of His kingdom and that He invited me to “work in His vineyard”, that is, to tell people about salvation in Jesus. Jesus, thank You for your grace. I want to tell people that today, they can be a part of Your Kingdom through faith in You.\n"}</script>

When their enemies started to harm them, the Israelites cried out to God for help and He heard them. He sent judges (redeemers) to free them from the power of the enemy.\n  Ch. 4-5: After some time, after certain judges died, the Israelites again stopped following God and their enemies again overpowered them in their land. The people again called out to God for help and He heard them. God wanted Barak to go and fight the enemies. Barak was afraid to go and asked Deborah, the prophetess, to go with him. She trusted God’s Word when He said that He would give them victory and went with him against the enemy. God gave them victory, but didn’t give Barak glory for the battle. Deborah and Barak sang a song about the greatness of God.\n  Ch. 6-8: Again, after time, the people turned away from worshipping God and their enemies oppressed them. They cried out to God for help and He sent them help. Gideon was working and cleaning his wheat secretly so that the enemy wouldn’t come and steal his food. An angel of God appeared to him and told him that God was with him and was sending him to tear down the idol they worshiped and save His people from the enemy. Gideon wasn’t sure and asked God to show him a sign. God confirmed His Word to Gideon. Gideon was afraid but he did what God told him to do. Many people joined Gideon to fight against the enemies. God wanted only a small number of people to fight so that they would know that the victory was from God and not from people. God said that everyone except for 300 people should go home. At night, Gideon and his army came to the enemy. God told them to take trumpets, jars and torches with them. They blew the trumpets loud, broke the jars and held the torches in their hands. God gave them victory over their enemies.\n  Ch. 9-12: “Then the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord” (10:6). Again and again, their enemies oppressed them.

I can call to Him for help and He hears me. I can sing songs about God to tell about His strength and love and greatness.\n  Gideon was afraid but he obeyed God. Even when I am afraid, I can be sure that Jesus is my help. He will give me courage to do what He says in His Word. Jesus is my saviour. God doesn’t need a lot of people to do what he wants.

They returned rejoicing about what they had done. Jesus said, “Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.” (v.20) Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit.  (v. 21)\n  Verses 25-27: Once, a person asked Jesus “what do I need to do to inherit eternal life?” Jesus asked him what the Scriptures say. The person answered correctly: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’ But then he asked “who is my neighbor?” Jesus answered with the following story: Once a man was traveling on the road and thieves robbed him and beat him. He lay there, wounded on the road. Later, a priest walked by, saw him but didn’t stop to help him. The next person was a Levi. He also passed by and didn’t help the wounded man lying on the road. The third person was a Samaritan. He helped him and paid for his treatment to get better.\n  Jesus then asked, which of the 3 people was a neighbor to the wounded man. The answer was, the one who showed him mercy. Jesus said, go and do the same.\n  Martha and Mary\nCharacter:\n- God has answers\n- Jesus sees the heart\n- Jesus is loving\n- Jesus is worthy to be loved\n- Jesus is teacher\n- He instructs\n- Jesus is Wise\nApplication: |\n  In this passage, a person asked Jesus a question. I too can ask God questions and know that answers are found in the Bible. The person wanted to have eternal life. How can I know if I will live eternally with Jesus? Do I love God? Can I love Jesus more? How? In Jesus’ parable, 2 people who were Jews didn’t stop to help the Jew who was hurt. Do I sometimes not help my friends or my parents? Why don’t I help? Maybe I’m in a hurry? Many it’s inconvenient? Maybe I’m afraid?\n  Then the Samaritan, who historically wasn’t friends with the Jews, decided to stop and help the man. Samaritans and Jews were enemies, but he helped him. Which people groups today don’t really like one another? What does God want me to do when I see that my “enemy” is suffering?\n  Jesus loved me when I was still a sinner and His enemy (Rom 5:10). He died for me and for all people in the world. Jesus loved me and now because I love Jesus and am thankful to Him for salvation and forgiveness and eternal life, I want to love others and show them Jesus’ love. __God, help me to love You and my neighbor. Show me how to love more and give me boldness and strength to love when it is hard.__\n\n  Regarding v. 38-42: Jesus teaches that fellowship with Him (whether we are serving or sitting) is most important. He wants me to love Him and others regardless of what I am doing. Martha served but she was anxious about many things and Jesus wanted her to choose relationship with HIm, something that cannot be taken away. __Jesus, help me to love You and others in all that I do.__\n"}</script>

This is my God,\n  and I will praise Him, my father’s God, and I will exalt Him.”\nSummary: |\n  The people of Israel weren’t following God and their enemies started to oppress them. An angel of the Lord  appeared to a woman and told her that she would have a special child. This child should live according to special rules to show that he would participate in God’s special plan. This child was Samson. He grew up very strong and God gave him special strength to fight against the enemies. His strength was from God and God told him to follow special rules and to not cut his hair. Samson was often disobedient to God and didn’t follow those rules.\n  A woman named  Delilah persuaded Samson to tell her the secret of his special strength that if his hair was cut, he would lose it. She betrayed him to the Philistines (the enemies) for money. When he slept, they cut his hair and he lost his strength. Samson had killed many enemies but now he was their slave in their prison. Later, his hair started to grow and he asked God to give him strength to destroy the temple he was in, where his enemies were worshiping a false god. God answered his prayer. Samson died along with his enemies.\n\n  see also Heb 11:32-34 “And what more can I say? Time is too short for me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets, 33 who by faith …gained strength after being weak, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight.”\nCharacter:\n- God sees everything and everyone\n- God is strong\n- God is our help\n- God is holy (He is separate from us, different and pure)\n- God is our strength\nApplication: |\n  Samson did not always live the way that God wanted and fell into trouble. When I love Jesus, He can help me to love the truth and the right way. I want to follow God because He is the only one worthy of glory and He is worthy to be followed. God helps me in difficulties. God is my strength. Jesus gives me strength and joy to live in the way that He asks. The Holy Spirit helps me.\n  Often in the book of Judges, it says that the Spirit of the Lord came upon a person and gave them strength to stand against the enemy (14:6). Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit for strength to tell people about salvation in Jesus, to love God and to follow Jesus and not to evil. The Holy Spirit changes my heart and gives me love for God (Rom. 5:5). __Lord Jesus, give me your strength to love you and others. __\n"}</script>

One of them was: “Then He said: “A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.” (v.11-13) Later when things were really difficult for him, he said “ I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,  and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’ But “ when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.” (v.18-20) And his father threw a party for his son “ for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” (v.24) The father’s older son heard the party and complained to the father that he had never thrown a party for him even though he had always lived correctly. The father said “…‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.’” (v.31)\nCharacter:\n- God is the Heavenly Father\n- God is generous and loving\n- He is merciful\n- God sees everything\n- God receives the repentant one as a son\n- God reconciles us to Himself\n- God celebrates when people are reconciled to Him\n- God gives life\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God wants to save the lost\nApplication: |\n  In His parable, Jesus tells about 2 sons who represent 2 kinds of people. The first is the younger son, who didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He took what he could from his father and lived his own way. But later he realized his mistake, repented and by his father’s mercy became a part of the family again. Maybe I am like this son? I want to live my own way and I don’t care what God says, what the Bible says and what people tell me about Jesus. There were a lot of people like that who repented and started to trust God and follow Him in the time when Jesus lived on the earth. They were spiritually dead and far from God but through faith in Jesus they became alive and close to God. I also can come to the Heavenly Father through faith in Jesus and know that He receives me. I can tell people about Jesus’ love and tell them that God wants to forgive their sin and give them eternal life.\n  But maybe I’m more like the 2nd son. He also didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He just did what he was suppose to do out of obligation or duty. He thought that he deserved a party because he was obedient but he didn’t know his father. He didn’t want his younger brother to find the father’s mercy and love. He thought that only he, who had lived right should get what was good. He didn’t know the loving heart of his father and he wasn’t glad when his brother who had been “dead” became “alive”. In the time when Jesus lived on earth there were pharisees who knew God’s law and fulfilled it well. They thought that they deserved good things from the Heavenly Father. They complained when “sinners” ate with Jesus and He talked with them. They weren’t glad when people who had been “dead” and far from God started to come to God through Jesus and became “alive”. Maybe I also live right and think that I deserve good things from God because of “my righteousness”? In reality, all people sin and everyone needs the righteousness of Jesus to be part of God’s family. Why do I listen to God or my parents or do what is right? Love and thankfulness towards God the Father give me a desire to obey God. When I see the loving heart of God, I want to call everyone to Him that they would also be near to God and join the party that God has planned for all those who love Jesus and those that He loves so much!\n"}</script>

Her sons married girls there who were not Israelites.  Naomi’s husband and sons died. Naomi returned to the land of Israel and one of her daughters- in-law, Ruth, believed in God and wanted to stay with Naomi to help her. Ruth went to work in a field gathering grain (see Num. 24:19-22). She was a hard worker. The owner of the field, Boaz, met her and gave her food. He said that she should work at his field where it was safe. Naomi knew the law about redemption in Israel. According to this law, a close relative could marry Ruth and then take care of her and Naomi. Boaz was a close relative. Naomi told Ruth to go remind Boaz that he was a close relative. Boaz loved God and wanted to help but he waited to see if the other close relative wanted to do fulfill the redemption law and buy Naomi’s land and marry Ruth. However, that relative didn’t want to marry Ruth. Then Boaz was happy to marry Ruth and God gave them a child. Naomi thanked God. That child became the grandfather of David.\nCharacter:\n- God is wise\n- God is faithful\n- He is always with us\n- God is our help\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- He paid for our sin, protects us and cares for us\n- God has a good plan\n- Jesus is the Saviour of all peoples\nApplication: |\n  Boaz is a picture (someone who shows us something) of Jesus. Boaz paid a price to redeem Naomi’s land and to marry Ruth. Jesus paid a price when He died for me on the cross to redeem me from my sin and make me His own. He is my saviour who loves me and cares about me. I can come to Jesus for help. I am glad that He never leaves me or forsakes me.\n  Ruth is a picture of the nations (non Israelites) who are a part of the Church. Israel is God’s special people and He showed His plan of salvation through them. He wants all people on earth to know about Him through the Israelites. Ruth, a Gentile (from the nations) came to know God and she was redeemed. Jesus is the Redeemer of people from all nations who trust Him for salvation. Through faith, Ruth became a part of God’s plan. Through faith in Jesus, I too am a part of God’s plan. __Jesus, use my life so that many people will come to know you, that you are Redeemer.__\n  God fulfilled His plan to give Israel the promised Redeemer through the family of Ruth and Boaz. Their great grandson David (about whom we will learn soon) became king and God promised him that the Messiah would come through David’s family. After many years, Jesus fulfilled this promise and came from the family of David. He is our King and Redeemer.\n"}</script>

Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.  And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.  So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him,“Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.”  So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully.  But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, “He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.”\n  Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.”\n  And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:1-10)\n  “And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, 2 and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites. 3 So He said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all; 4 for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.” (Luke 21:1-4)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus knows all hearts\n- Jesus is loving\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus knows everything and everyone\n- God wants to seek and save us\n- God changes hearts\n- Jesus is God with us\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\n- God is giving\nApplication: |\n  Zacchaeus was a dishonest person who offended many people. He really wanted to see Jesus. He probably heard that Jesus did many miracles and that people called Him Saviour. Jesus knew Zacchaeus’ name and knew that he was watching Him from the tree. He knew that he had stolen money from people. Jesus wanted to be with Zacchaeus and change his life. Jesus sought to spend time with a person that everyone in the town hated. Jesus loved him and wanted to save him. Zacchaeus really changed after spending time (fellowshipping) with Jesus. He became honest and generous,  not selfish, after he experienced Jesus’ love.\n  Zacchaeus was looking for Jesus when he climbed the tree, but Jesus was looking for him! Jesus knew his heart and He knows my heart. He knows my sins and how I can be greedy or selfish. He knows my name. He wants to spend time with me. At any time or any place, I can talk with (fellowship) with Him and not only when I pray, read the Bible or sing worship songs! When I fellowship with Jesus, He changes me! I experience His love and care and He gives me love for others. He fills me with the Holy Spirit and gives me a new heart that loves God and others.\n  Maybe other people see that I fellowship with Jesus and they don’t like it. God’s opinion is most important and not the opinion of people. It’s important to know that Jesus loves me and to love Him. I want to tell people about Jesus so they would believe in Him and that He would change their lives. Only Jesus can change a person’s heart. I want to pray for ____________, that like Zacchaeus, they would know Jesus and that God would change him/her just like He changed Zacchaeus. I want to be loving and generous like Jesus and like Zacchaeus. __Jesus, help me to love like You love. Thank you for seeking me, finding me and saving me. Thank you that you change my heart and my life!__\n\n  Luke 21:1-4: In this passage, people gave gifts to God. They wanted to say that all that they had was really from God and that we give Him what already belongs to Him. They said thank you to Him for providing for them. Jesus saw that some people gave money but they didn’t really think that all that they had was God’s and belongs to Him. But God, Jesus, saw the poor widow and said that even though she didn’t give much money, she actually gave more than the others because she gave out of her poverty and understood that all she had came from God and belongs to Him. She is a good example for me. I know that all I have is from God. I want to use everything for His glory. It’s not right to think that only a part of what I have belongs to God.\n  Jesus, please show me how to use what You have given me. My toys, money, clothes, home, time, strength and life is all from God. Jesus, show me how I can praise and thank You for all that You give. Maybe I can give some of my toys to someone. Maybe I can give some of my clothes to an orphanage. I want to have a thankful heart like that widow who trusted God with everything that she had. __Jesus, You gave all for me. You gave Your life for me. Thank you for Your love and care. Jesus, help me to see that everything is from You and help me to say thank you for everything and have a thankful heart.__\n\n  *We can compare Zacchaeus’ attitude towards money with that of the widow’s. When I trust God in everything, He helps me to be generous and giving. __Jesus, give me a heart that trusts You and uses everything You give for Your glory.__\n"}</script>

Look at her prayer in ch. 2 and notice what she knew about the character of God. Look at the last verse. She prayed about God’s anointed one! We know that this Anointed One is the Savior and King, Jesus. Anna lived long before the birth of Jesus but she knew God’s promise and believed that He would fulfill it. I believe that Jesus is the Anointed One, that is, the Savior, The Messiah and King. I want to rejoice in God like Anna did. I want to tell people that He answers our prayers and that He has already sent Jesus, who saves from sin.\n"}</script>

And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:“Hosanna to the Son of David! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!”  And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?” So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”\n  verses 12-22: Jesus drove the sellers out of the temple and said “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.” (v.13) The leaders in the temple were upset that children were praising Jesus when He healed people. Jesus answered that the children fulfilled God’s Word (Ps. 8:2).\n  verses 23-27: The leaders wanted to know by what authority Jesus did and said these things. But they didn’t want to recognize that John the Baptist’s ministry was from God and so Jesus didn’t answer their question.\n\n  Verses 28-32: Jesus told a parable of the 2 sons. In the end, one was obedient and one was not.\n\n  Verses 33-45: Jesus told the parable of the vineyard and the workers who didn’t receive the master’s son when he came to the vineyard. The Pharisees heard the parable and wanted to lay hands on Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is King\n- Jesus is humble\n- Jesus fulfills God’s Word\n- Jesus is worthy of praise\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- He saves\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is God and King of kings. He is the only King who is worthy of worship. Many years before Jesus came to earth, the Holy Spirit directed the prophet Zechariah to write that the King and Saviour would come into Jerusalem on a donkey. I see that God fulfills all that He says in His Word. I can trust the Word and God. The Bible is the truth.\n  People worshiped Jesus. They laid  their clothes  and palm branches on the road where He rode and cried out “Hosanna!” which means “Lord, Save!” I also can worship Jesus. I can sing songs to Him, pray to Him and thank Him for salvation. I want to give Him honor because He is worthy! People in Jerusalem heard the noise and asked “who is this?” When I praise Jesus with my life and people ask “who is this Jesus that you are talking about?” I can answer that He is the Saviour and the Eternal King! What does a king do? A good king rules over people, he takes care of them,  he makes decisions and he says what is right and wrong, he is the one in charge. Is Jesus my king?  Jesus, be the King of my life. You are my Saviour and You want to save everyone. __Thank you that You are coming again and that I will be with You in your kingdom of love. __\n"}</script>

The sons of Eli served at the tabernacle but they didn’t love God and they did bad things. God sent a person to tell Eli that God didn’t like what they were doing and He would punish them (1 Sam. 2:27-36). One night, Samuel heard God’s voice calling him. He didn’t understand and thought Eli was calling him. Eli didn’t understand right away that God was calling Samuel. When Samuel heard God’s words to him, he shared them with Eli. God told Samuel what the first person said: that God would judge Eli’s family and their sin against Him. Samuel served God and did what was pleasing to God. He was a prophet (a person who receives God’s Word and shares it with people).\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign (God controls everything)\n- God sees everything and knows everything\n- God punishes sin.God is holy\n- He is worthy to receive sincere worship\n- God speaks to us\nApplication: |\n  Samuel was a young boy, but God spoke to Him. God also speaks to me through His Word, the Bible. I can know what is pleasing to God through His Word. God had a plan for Samuel’s life and God has a plan my life. God saw the sin of Eli’s sons and punished them. God knows everything that I do, think and say. Am I pleasing God in the way that I live? He doesn’t want me to act like I’m worshiping Him when my heart is not really loving Him. Jesus helps me to live God’s way. His Holy Spirit gives me love for God and others (Rom 5:5). Samuel shared God’s words and  God wants me to share His Word with other people. Jesus, speak to me, I am listening to your Word.\n  1 Sam. 3:7 says, “Now Samuel had not yet experienced the Lord, because the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him.” He was in the place of worship, but he himself did not yet know God. I can go to church, where people worship God but may not know Jesus. Samuel heard God’s Word and believed it. He then began to personally fellowship with God. I also want to know God’s Word (the Bible) and believe what I read. I want to personally seek Jesus and follow Him. Have I asked Jesus to forgive my sin? Do I believe that Jesus is God, that he died for my sins, rose again and wants to give me forgiveness and a new heart that loves God and others? Do I want to tell people about Jesus, the Savior and warn them that God will punish those that don’t receive the gift of salvation? Jesus is calling me every day to follow Him. In Jesus is life, hope, joy, peace and love.\n\n  (Suggestion: Listen to the song, “The Same Love” by Paul Baloche which talks about  Jesus calling people to Himself. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAK3t6uG58Q)\n"}</script>

Many guests were invited to the wedding feast of the king’s son, but they didn’t want to come and treated the king’s servants rudely. He punished them and invited other people from the streets. At the feast, the king saw one person who wasn’t dressed in the wedding clothes and asked him why this was, but the person was speechless. The king gave a command to throw him into outer darkness.\n\n  In verses 15-22, people deceitfully asked Jesus about His attitude towards taxes. He said “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” (v.21)\n\n  23-33 The Sadducees (a religious group of people) didn’t believe in the resurrection and asked Jesus about it. He quoted Scripture saying, “‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.” (v.32)\n\n  34-40 A lawyer wanted to test Jesus and asked: what is the greatest commandment? “Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and great commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.  On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.” (v. 37-40)\n\n  41-46 Jesus asked them how they understand whose son the Messiah is from Ps. 110:1 where David wrote, “The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.”They couldn’t answer Him.\n\n  Matt. 23:1-36 Jesus said, “woe to you Pharisees and scribes” He taught that people shouldn’t be like them. Rather,“… he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” (v.11-12) He said that they hindered people from coming to God. They kept the law but, “have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone” (v.23) They took care of the outer appearance but God wants the heart to be clean. Worst of all, they rejected the Word of God just as those who lived earlier, who killed God’s prophets.\n\n  37-39 Jesus said that Jerusalem is the city that doesn’t receive God’s truth and will be punished. He said, “ for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ (v.39)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is the Son of God\n- He is King\n- He is wise and wiser than all\n- Jesus will judge unbelievers\nApplication: |\n  In these chapters, Jesus speaks with the Pharisees and scribes who knew God’s Word very well. But they didn’t follow God’s Word. They rejected the truth of the Word and didn’t fulfill the greatest commandment: love God and others. They rejected Jesus, the Messiah (Savior). They loved the glory and praise of man and didn’t want to give glory to God. They thought that through keeping the Law, they would be accepted by God. But they relied upon their own righteousness, not knowing that their righteousness was sin in God’s eyes. (in the parable of the wedding feast, the wedding clothes represent Jesus’ righteousness). Only Jesus’ righteousness can save me so that I can be with God! My good deeds can’t save me. Jesus wants me to trust His righteousness. He wants me to love Him and others. When I trust Him and His righteousness, He gives me a new heart and He gives me the Holy Spirit. I am a new creation and I know that I am saved by grace. I don’t want glory for myself anymore but want to give glory to Jesus! I believe in God’s Word. I want to love others in Jesus’ name.\n  __Jesus, help me to not live for pleasing people and myself by doing good deeds in self-righteousness. Help me to always remember that You are my Righteousness and that You save me by grace. Thank you, that you saved me!__\n"}</script>

There is no one besides You!\n  And there is no rock like our God.”\nSummary: |\n  The people of Israel fought against the Philistines. Israel lost the first battle and many people died. In the next battle, they brought the ark of the covenant and thought that it would help them to win. But the Philistines won and took the ark of the covenant. During the battle, the sons of Eli died. When Eli heard the news that the ark was captured, he fell over and died. The words of God about his household were fulfilled. Later, in the Philistine cities, wherever the ark was, people had lots of problems and sickness. God even made the statue of their false god fall over in front of the ark. The Philistines decided to send the ark back to Israel. They put it on a wagon along with gifts on the road leading to Israel.\n  The Israelites were glad that the ark returned to them and worshipped God right away. Some people looked into the ark and died. Samuel led the people in sincere worship of God and they put away all their idols. When the Philistines attacked again, God protected them.\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign (He controls everything)\n- God is the only God and there are no others besides Him\n- God is worthy of worship\n- He is strong\n- He shows that He is the only God\nApplication: |\n  I know that nothing and no one is stronger or more important that God. God should be the most important person in my life. When I trust God (Jesus), He protects me from enemies. Jesus, help me to make you the most important person in my life. Things (money or people) can’t save me from problems. I need Jesus, who forgives my sin and changes my heart. He is with me in difficulties and guides me.\n  *It’s interesting to notice that the Philistines knew about God. What did they know? See 1 Sam. 4:8 and 6:6. They knew that God was strong but they didn’t believe that He is the only God and that they should leave their idols and follow the living God. I want to follow God fully. I want to tell people that it’s not enough to know that Jesus is the Savior, but that they need to trust Him completely. He alone is worthy of worship.\n"}</script>

There will be wars,  people who claim to be the Christ, false prophets and persecution of believers. “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.” (v.14)\n  Prophecy from the book of Daniel will be fulfilled and the great tribulation will begin. People shouldn’t believe those who say that Jesus has returned already, they should take shelter until it happens. “ For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be” (v 27) Christ’s return will be visible and clear to everyone and He will gather His own to Himself (v, 29-31)\n  Verses 32-51 Jesus says that the generation that sees all these signs (the changes in the sun, stars, persecution etc) will see His return. No one knows when Jesus will return and everyone should be ready. “ Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.” (v. 44) Those who serve God when Jesus returns will be blessed. Those who do not will go to hell.\n  Matt. 25:-13 Jesus told a parable of the 10 virgins who needed to always be ready for the grooms arrival.\n  Verses 14-30 Jesus told the parable of the talents.

I want to be ready for His return. No one knows when He will return (see Matt. 24:36). In 2 Pet. 3:10 it says, “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up”\n  I want to be like the 5 girls who had oil for their lamps. It looked like all the girls were ready for the wedding celebration, but in reality, not all of them were ready. They were standing in the right place (near the door) but only 5 of them had extra oil with them. Oil often symbolized the Holy Spirit. There are people who are in church, but in reality they don’t trust Jesus and don’t have the Holy Spirit (they are not born again). Jesus knows everyone and only those who trust Him will be with Him in heaven.\n  I want to be like the servant who used what his master gave him correctly. I want to love and serve God and people until the day when Jesus comes for me. When I love others and serve them it’s the same as serving and loving Jesus Himself (Matt. 25:40).\n  Jesus knows the hearts of all and only those who trust Him will be with Him in heaven. He saves those who love and trust Him. Do I trust Jesus? Do I love Jesus? If I trust Him, then I won’t fear Jesus’ return because I know that He saves me. He already saved me from sin and He promises to save me from God’s wrath.\n  I want to tell people about salvation in Jesus so that they wouldn’t go to hell where there is eternal torment. Jesus is the only One who can forgive sin and change the hearts of people. Jesus is Savior!\n"}</script>

Look: to obey is better than sacrifice,\n  to pay attention is better than the fat of rams.”'\nSummary: |\n  Samuel was old and his sons didn’t judge the people rightly, but took bribes. The Israelites asked Samuel to set a king over them, saying ”then we’ll be like all the other nations: our king will judge us, go out before us, and fight our battles” (8:20). Samuel didn’t want to, but God said, “they have not rejected you; they have rejected Me as their king” (8:7). Samuel met Saul when he was looking for his lost donkeys. God told Samuel that Saul would be Israel’s king. He anointed Saul as a sign that he was chosen by God. On the way home, the Holy Spirit came upon Saul and he started to prophesy (10:10). Later, Samuel gathered the people to officially present the new king. When Saul was called, they couldn’t find him because he hid himself. Saul was tall and handsome and when people saw him they shouted, “Long live the king!” (10:24).\n  After some time, the Ammonites threatened an Israelite city and the people there asked for help and protection. When Saul heard about it, the Holy Spirit came upon him (11:6) and he called Israel to fight. God gave them victory and saved them from their enemies. Later, Samuel talked with the people and warned them saying “…don’t turn away from following the Lord. Instead, worship the Lord with all your heart. 21 Don’t turn away to follow worthless things that can’t profit or deliver you; they are worthless” (12:20-21) and “Above all, fear the Lord and worship Him faithfully with all your heart; consider the great things He has done for you. 25 However, if you continue to do what is evil, both you and your king will be swept away” (12:24-25).\n\n  see also Ps. 33\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign (He rules over everything)\n- Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords\n- He sets up earthly kings\n- God is higher than everyone\n- He is always pure and righteous\n- God protects us from our enemies\n- He is Savior\n- He is worthy of obedience\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God gives the Holy Spirit\nApplication: |\n  Samuel warned the people to not stop loving God with their whole hearts. __Jesus, help me by Your Holy Spirit to love You more and more with my whole heart. I myself can’t love you and be obedient to you without your help. I depend upon You. Lead me and my life. Be the king of my heart. Remind me of all  your great deeds (salvation, victory on the cross, healing, miracles etc.).__\n  What does a king do? Do people listen to him? Why? How does the example of an earthly king help me to understand my relationship to Jesus? Jesus is the righteous, eternal, wise and loving King. He is worthy of honor and praise. I can trust God because He is a righteous King who controls everything. I know that God and His plans (and not mine) are the most important. He has a right to lead my life in the way that He wants and I can be happy to walk with Him. I know that God’s leading is for my good.\n"}</script>

Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. “ (Jn.13:15-16). Then Jesus explained to the disciples that soon He would die for them. He gave them to drink from the cup and said that the wine was like His blood that He would shed for them. He gave them bread and said that it was like His body that He would give to be broken for them. He said for them to drink and eat and “do this in remembrance of Me “ (Luke 22:19). Jesus said that He knew which one of the disciples would betray Him (Jn. 13:21). Judas Iscariot left and betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill Him.

Saul did not wait for Samuel and decided to sacrifice an offering to God himself.  Samuel told Saul that because of his disobedience, the kingdom would be given to another (13:13-14). Only Saul and Jonathan had weapons (13:22). Jonathan and his armor bearer went to see if God wanted them to fight the Philistines. He said, “…Nothing can keep the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few” (14:6). The Lord gave them victory. Saul and his army heard the noise of battle. Saul started to seek the Lord’s will about fighting but didn’t wait and decided to fight. He told his army not to eat until the battle was over. Jonathan didn’t hear his father’s order and ate honey.  Later, God didn’t answer Saul when he sought His will. God showed that Jonathan was guilty and Saul wanted to kill him but the soldiers saved him.\n  Chapter 15: Samuel told Saul that God wanted to send him to fight against the Amalekites and get rid of everything and everyone. The Amalekites had been mean to Israel earlier when they were coming out of slavery from Egypt. Saul won the battle but let the Amalekite king and the best of his animals live. Later, Saul put up a memorial to himself. Samuel came and told Saul that he had been disobedient to God. Saul did not admit his guilt right away and tried to prove that what he did was ok. God through Samuel said that obeying God’s voice is more important than offering sacrifices (15:22). Samuel also said “you rejected God’s word and He has rejected you, so you won’t be king, but He will set up a new person over Israel” (15:26-29). Saul was very upset and said that he had been afraid of the people and that was why he acted that way. When Samuel wanted to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his clothing and tore off a part of it . He really wanted Samuel to go with him to worship God in front of the people. God was sad that Saul was a disobedient king. Samuel continued to pray for Saul.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign (God controls everything)\n- Jesus is King of kings and God of all\n- God saves us from our enemies\n- He is Saviour\n- He is worthy of our obedience, respect and trust\n- ' God knows our hearts'\n- God is our help\n- God forgives sin and shows mercy\n- He is the Eternal One who does not lie or change His mind (1 Sam\n- 15:29)\nApplication: |\n  The Israelites wanted a king to lead them. God gave them Saul. Leaders can be good but people will always fail.  Jesus is the best King. He is King of kings. I want Him to be the  King of my heart. Saul was afraid of what people thought more than what God thought. He didn’t trust God’s word. When I trust Jesus, I don’t need to be afraid of what people think. I should wait to find out what God thinks about a situation and then act according to God’s will. He shows me His will in His Word.  I should listen to King Jesus. My obedience shows that I trust Him. Just doing things without trusting God isn’t pleasing to Him. God knows my heart and the reason that I do things.  Jesus, help me to not fear people’s opinion but to follow and respect You. Show me in Your Word what is pleasing to You and help me to trust You and do it.__ Give me a heart that loves and trusts You.__\n  God is trustworthy. Jonathan trusted God and He gave him victory. Jonathan sought God’s will and then did it. God never fails. However, Jonathan sinned when he didn’t respect his father, Saul, and spoke rudely about him when he heard about the command to not eat. God wants me to respect my parents.\n  The fear of the Lord is when we respect and love God more than anyone else. Jesus, teach me to have the right fear of the Lord. You are Great and You are worthy of my trust.\n"}</script>

Even though He could have called angels to fight for Him (Matt. 26:53), He bravely went with the soldiers because He knew that it was God’s plan from eternity to die for our sins. I don’t doubt that Jesus is the Son of God and that He loves me. I am very thankful to Jesus for His Great Love. Jesus fulfilled the will of the Father and not His own. Jesus and the Father’s will were the same. Jesus helps me to fulfill His will and not my own. He helps me so that what I want is the same as what God wants. Often, my will is selfish (something that makes only me glad), but God’s will is what makes Jesus glad.__ Jesus, help me to fulfill Your will and serve and love as You do.__\n"}</script>

Man does not see what the Lord sees, for man sees what is visible, but the\n  Lord sees the heart.”\nSummary: |+\n  God told Samuel to anoint one of Jesse’s sons in Bethlehem as king over Israel. Jesse had 8 sons. Samuel thought that the oldest one would be king because of his appearance. But God said, “Do not look at his appearance or his stature, because I have rejected him. Man does not see what the Lord sees, for man sees what is visible, but the Lord sees the heart” (16:7). Finally, they called David, the youngest son who was taking care of the sheep and God told Samuel to anoint him as king. The Holy Spirit filled David from that day forward (16:13).\n  Later, during a time of war with the Philistines, Jesse sent David to bring cheese and bread to his brothers who were serving in the army with Saul. However, no one was fighting because they were afraid of the Philistines’ warrior, Goliath. He wanted to fight with one Israelite to decide the war. Goliath said rude things about God. David heard him, trusted God and decided to fight with him. Saul found out and wanted to give him armour, but it was too big for David. David chose 5 stones from the river and told Goliath, “You come against me with a dagger, spear, and sword, but I come against you in the name of Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel’s armies—you have defied Him…Today, I’ll strike you down… 47 and this whole assembly will know that it is not by sword or by spear that the Lord saves, for the battle is the Lord’s. He will hand you over to us” (17:45-47).

It’s important to God that I would have a heart that trusts Him. The priority is not how I look or what people think about me. __Jesus, please help me not to judge people by their outward appearance. Help me to trust you with all of my heart.__\n  David knew that God is great and could give victory over the Goliath. He didn’t trust his own strength but trusted God. I also can trust God. When there are big problems and evil people, I can ask God for help. He gives me strength to stand against evil. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit, who helps me to love God, trust Him, live God’s way and share with people about Jesus.  __Jesus, give me a heart that trusts You and is ready to do what you ask me to do.

They wanted to kill Him because He said that He is the Son of God and they didn’t believe it. Pilate knew that Jesus wasn’t guilty but he was afraid of what people thought and gave the order to crucify Jesus. During the time of judgement, Peter denied Jesus 3 times, just like Jesus said. Peter cried. Pilate sent Jesus to Herod. The soldiers were very rude to Jesus, beat Him and laughed at Him. Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate wanted to release Jesus but the people asked for a criminal to be released instead. They shouted “crucify Him!” and so Pilate agreed to crucify Jesus.\n  Jesus hung on the cross between 2 thieves. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised that he would be with Him in paradise. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the veil in the temple tore from the top to bottom. Jesus said “It is finished!” (Jn 19:30). He died.\n  The disciples saw where Jesus’ body was buried, in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Savior\n- Jesus is the perfect sacrifice for sin\n- Jesus fulfills prophecy\n- He is loving\n- He took my punishment\n- Jesus is Redeemer and forgives our sins (Col 1:14)\n- Jesus is sinless (2 Cor 5:21, Heb 4:15)\n- Jesus brings us to God (1 Pet 3:18)\n- Jesus is the propitiation for our sin, He satisfies the wrath of God by the sacrifice\n  of Himself (1 Jn 4:10)\n- Jesus loved us and washed us from our sins with His blood (Rev 1:5)\n- Jesus proved His love for us (Rom\n- 5:8)\nApplication: |\n  Jesus loves us! He gave His life for us. It was His choice to give His life. I know that Jesus died for my sins and rose again. Only He lived a sinless life and only He can forgive my sin and cleanse me. By faith, He imputes His righteousness to me (attributes His righteousness to me). I trust His Righteousness and know that only by faith in Him, I am saved. I am not saved by good works or good behavior. Jesus saves me by His grace. I want to tell everyone about my Saviour, Jesus! He loves us and wants to give us a heart that loves God and others. He promises to receive me in heaven so that I can be with Him forever! This is GOOD NEWS that everyone needs to hear!\n\n  *note: between the gospel accounts, there are many details surrounding Jesus’ trial, crucifixion and resurrection.

Saul kept David with him to serve him. People sang a song about how David was a great warrior and Saul was jealous of David (18:7). Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear. He made David a commander in the army and God was with David and helped him. Then Saul told David that he could marry his daughter if he killed 100 Philistines. He thought that the Philistines would kill David in battle, but David did what Saul wanted and became his son-in-law. Saul feared David because God was with him (18:12).\n  Saul wanted to kill David, but Jonathan convinced his father not to do it. Later, Saul wanted to kill David again and was watching his house, but David’s wife helped him to run away (Ps. 59). David went to Samuel. When Saul wanted to take David away, all the people that he sent to get him began prophesying (speaking God’s word) because the Holy Spirit came upon them (19:23).\n  David went to Jonathan and asked why Saul wanted to kill him. Jonathan had a plan to find out and later told David. Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and he knew that his father wanted to kill David. He was sad and told David that he should leave Saul. Jonathan and David promises to always be friends and to care for one another’s children (20:42).\n  Ch. 21-22: David ran to Nob, where there was a priest. He asked for the bread that usually only the priests are allowed to eat. David lied and said that he was doing the king’s business. The priest gave him the bread and Goliath’s sword which was there. One of Saul’s servants, Doeg saw everything.\n  David ran away further to the king of Gath (a pagan king). He regarded David as an enemy. Then David pretended to be crazy in order to run away from him (see Ps.34, 56). David left and lived far away from Saul (Ps. 63). His family and others gathered to him. Doeg told Saul that the priest helped David and so Saul killed the priest and his relatives (Ps. 52). One of them escaped to David and David promised to protect him.\n\n  see also Ps.7, 13, 20, 22, 27, 31, 34, 52, 56, 59\n  *Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not. You may want to read some of the psalms that could be from this period of David’s life. \n\nCharacter:\n- God is faithful\n- He is loving\n- Jesus is a faithful friend\n- God is our help and defence\n- God has a plan that He fulfills\n- Jesus makes a covenant of friendship and love with us\n- God is merciful\n- God is honest\n- God loves the truth\nApplication: |\n  God is faithful to me. He is my help and defence. Jesus is the most faithful friend. He showed His love when He died on the cross for my sins. He forgives my sin and gives me a new relationship with God. Through faith in Jesus, I can belong to God’s eternal family.\n  When God is most important to us and to our friendships (as in the example of Jonathan and David’s friendship), we can be a good support to one another. Jesus shows me how to love and support others.\n  Even when people don’t treat me well (as David experienced), I can know that God is with me and that He fulfills His good plan for my life. David was wrong when he answered the priest deceitfully. The priest suffered because of David’s lie. God, help me to trust You and to always answer honestly\n  Jealous and envy (as we saw in Saul) destroys friendship and brings pain to all those around. __Jesus, forgive me when I envy. Give me a pure heart and a right attitude. Help me to trust You because You are the most faithful friend.__\n"}</script>

Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\n"}</script>

Then, Saul found out that David was there and the people of the city were ready to betray him to Saul. Saul wanted to kill David. Jonathan came to David to strengthen him in trusting God. David was in the wilderness and Saul almost caught him on a mountain.\n  Ch. 24: David was in a cave and Saul came in to sit there. David could have killed Saul, but he didn’t want to. Instead, he cut off a corner of his clothing and afterwards showed Saul to prove that he didn’t want to kill him.\n  Ch. 25: Samuel died. David asked for food from Nabal, but Nabal answered him rudely and refused. David was angry and ready to kill Nabal, but Abigail, Nabal’s wife, acted wisely and asked David not to avenge himself. Later, Nabal died and Abigail became David’s wife.\n  Ch. 26: People in the city of Ziph told Saul where he could find David (Ps. 54). He again sought to kill him. During the night, David went to Saul’s camp and could have killed him, but didn’t he want to. He took Saul’s spear and a jar from near his head. Then he stood far away and yelled to Abner (Saul’s army commander), that he should do a better job of protecting the king. Saul blessed David.\n  Ch. 27: David was afraid of Saul and decided to live in the land of the enemy. He lived there for over a year.

He didn’t want to kill Saul, because he trusted God’s plan. Even though God had told David long before that he would be Israel’s king, David didn’t want to become king through murdering Saul. David trusted God for His timing to fulfill His plan. I can trust God that He will fulfill His plans in His time for my life. Even though Saul acted like David’s enemy, David continued to respect Saul. Maybe there are people in my life who treat me like an enemy, but God wants me to love them. He gives me strength and wisdom to love them.\n  God sent Abigail to David when he started to avenge himself. God gave her wise words and David was thankful that he didn’t sin. Sometimes, God sends people to me to warn me. Am I ready to listen to their advice that helps me to trust God and not make a mistake? Am I ready to share advice from the Bible with people when God, by the Holy Spirit shows me that I should say something? Jesus, I want to trust You.

Jesus walked nearby with them but they didn’t recognize Him (v. 16). Jesus heard their conversation about His resurrection, the empty grave, the angel’s words and what the women saw. He explained to them what is written about Him in Scripture. They came to Emmaus and invited Jesus to eat with them. They started to eat together and when Jesus took the bread to thank God, their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus! Then He disappeared! They decided to hurry back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples that they saw Jesus, even though it was already evening.\n  They told the disciples in Jerusalem that they saw the Risen Lord Jesus and all of the sudden, He appeared in the room with them. At that time, Thomas wasn’t with them and he didn’t believe that the others saw Jesus. He wanted to see the wounds of Jesus himself and be sure that Jesus was alive. After 8 days, Thomas was with the disciples and Jesus appeared again. “Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.”  And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (Jn. 20:27-29). see also Lk 24:44-45\n  Seven of Jesus’ disciples went fishing. Jesus stood on the shore and asked if they had caught any fish. They answered that they hadn’t. He told them to throw the net on the other side of the boat and when they did, they caught a large amount of fish right away. John recognized that it was Jesus on the shore. Peter jumped out of the boat and swam to Jesus. Jesus had already prepared breakfast for them.\n  Later, Jesus and Peter had a conversation. Jesus asked him, “do you love me more than these?” Peter said, “Lord, You know that I love you.” Jesus told him to feed His sheep. (Jn. 21:15-16). Jesus asked Peter twice more and finally Peter answered “Lord, You know all things, You know that I love You.” (Jn. 21:17)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is alive\n- Jesus fulfills God’s Word\n- Jesus is everywhere\n- Nothing can hinder Jesus\n- He hears and knows everything\n- Jesus is caring and reconciles us with Himself\n- Nothing hinders Jesus\n- Jesus is the Good Shepherd\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus rose from the dead even though I don’t see Him like His disciples saw Him. Others saw Him and passed on to us the truth that Jesus is alive. Jesus explained that the whole Bible talks about Him (Jn 5:39-40). God said earlier in the Word that He would send a Saviour who would die for everyone’s sins and rise again on the 3rd day. The words of Moses, the prophets and many psalms talk about Jesus. I see that Jesus fulfills these Word of prophecy. I can trust the Bible.\n  Jesus gives those who believe in Him the Holy Spirit (John 20:22-23). I rely upon God’s power to follow after Jesus and to tell others about Him.  The disciples told others that Jesus is alive. I also can tell people, friends and relatives that Jesus is alive. I can tell them that He died for our sins and can forgive us because He paid for our sins (He took our punishment and paid with His blood). Jesus heard that Thomas wanted to touch His wounds. Jesus knows all my thoughts and hears all my words. He doesn’t want me to doubt Him but helps me to trust Him.\n  Jesus promises to raise up to life, those who believe in Him. The Risen Lord Jesus ate and could appear in rooms that were locked. This was His glorified body. He promises to give each believer in Him a glorified body. That body will never get sick because then there will be no more sin. When we have our glorified body, we will live with Jesus. He already conquered sin but we are waiting for that day when Jesus will return again and take us to be with Him. He gives believers in Him salvation and new life now but we also are waiting for the day when He will save us from this fallen world and give us new life in His presence forever in heaven! While we wait, we can tell everyone that Jesus is alive, that He wants to forgive sins and that He is coming soon to save His own and to punish those who don’t believe in Him. see also 1 Cor. 15:54-57\n  Jesus knew where His disciples were and what they were doing. He met them and helped them in a miraculous way. The miraculous catch of fish was just like a miracle He performed at the beginning of His earthly ministry. He cared for His disciples and made breakfast for them. Jesus always knows where I am and what I am doing. He knows my needs. He is my Help. He cares for me.\n  Earlier, when Peter was afraid, he denied Jesus 3 times and said that he didn’t know Him. He was sad and Jesus knew this. Jesus spoke separately with Peter and 3 times asked Peter if he loved Him. Jesus reconciled Peter with Himself. Now, Peter could tell Jesus that he loved Him. Peter understood that Jesus forgave his sin. When I sin, I am not showing that I love Jesus. I can ask Jesus for forgiveness. I can ask Jesus to help me love Him more than anything else. Jesus wanted Peter to take care of others. I can ask Jesus to show me how to love those around me. There are many people who don’t know about Jesus’ love and care. I can tell them how they can be reconciled to God through faith in Jesus. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit, who gives me power to share about Jesus.\n"}</script>

Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.” (Acts 1:7-9)\n  They worshipped Him and looked at the sky. Angels told them that Jesus would return in the same way that He went up to heaven.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus promises to give the Holy Spirit to believers in Him\n- Jesus is holy\n- Jesus fulfills God’s Word\n- Jesus is King of kings\n- Jesus wants to save all people\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God the Father in heaven (Heb 1:3, Heb  12:2)\n- Jesus will come again (Heb 9:28)\n- Jesus makes believers witnesses to Him (Acts 1:8)\nApplication: |\n  I know that Jesus is in heaven now and that He will return to be King on earth. He gives the Holy Spirit to believers so they can tell people about Him. He is always with me. He tells believers to go and make disciples (followers of Jesus) and to baptize them and to teach them Jesus’ words. Am I a disciple of Jesus? If I am, then I have the Holy Spirit and Jesus is always with me.\n  __Jesus, please help me tell people that You are God, that You died for people’s sins, that You rose on the 3rd day and that You forgive our sins and give us the Holy Spirit to live God’s way and share with others about You. Help me to tell people all over the world about Your Great Love for them.__\n  Jesus will return (Acts 1:11). I am waiting for that day and want people to believe in Him so they can be forgiven and be with Jesus forever. I don’t want people to be punished and be without Jesus forever.  I want them to rejoice in Jesus along with me now and when He will reign in His eternal kingdom. __Jesus, thank you that You are coming soon and even though I don’t see you now, I know that you are always with me. But one day you will return and then I’ll see you face to face.__\n"}</script>

He reigned for 7 years there. The armies of Judah and Israel fought but the army of David was stronger.\n  Ch. 3: Abner, the commander of Saul’s army helped, so that all of Israel received David as king. But David’s army commander, Joab, deviously killed Abner. David mourned Abner.\n  Ch. 4. Saul’s son, who had taken the throne, was killed and Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth fell and became crippled. The people who killed Saul’s son wanted a reward, but David punished them instead.\n  Ch. 5: David officially became king of Israel. He captured the city of Jerusalem. He fought against the Philistines.\n  Ch. 6: David wanted to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. But they carried it wrong and God killed the people who wanted to catch the ark when it started to fall. David was scared. Later, they carried the ark the right way, as written in the law and on the way to Jerusalem they offered sacrifices for sin. David and the people celebrated and David danced before God. His first wife (Saul’s daughter) told him that she didn’t like his behavior, but David said that he danced before God and not for people.\n  Ch. 7: David wanted to build a temple for God but God said that He didn’t want David to built it. Instead, God promised to “build” David’s house so that there would always be someone from the house of David who could sit on the throne in Israel. David was thankful and worshiped God.\n\n  see also Ps. 9, 17, 18, 21, 36, 40\n  *Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not. You may want to read some of the psalms that could be from this period of David’s life.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Faithful King\n- God fulfills His promises\n- God loves righteousness\n- He is worthy to be worshiped\nApplication: |\n  David waited a long time for God to fulfill His promise to make him king. The Bible has many promises and I also am waiting for some of them to be fulfilled. But I am confident that God in His time will fulfill them. For example, I know that Jesus will return to reign forever. I believe that Jesus is the eternal King and I am waiting for His return. Now, He reigns in my heart.\n  God promised David that there will always be someone from his family on the throne. This Word is fulfilled in Jesus. He is the eternal King and He was born from the line of David. David was a great king in Israel and humbly worshiped God. God is a great King and He is worthy of my worship. I don’t want to worship God so that others would see and think good things about me. I want to simply look to Jesus because He is worthy of praise.\n  David wanted to build the temple. Maybe I want to do something nice for God to show Him that I love HIm. God doesn’t need anything but He is pleased when I express my love to Him. God showed me that He loved me when He sent Jesus to die on the cross for me. I show Him that I love Him when, through the strength of His Holy Spirit, I daily trust Him and worship Him by doing what He tells me to do in His Word .\n"}</script>

And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them.  And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?” (Acts 2:1-7).\n  People from all different nations heard the believers speaking about the mighty works of God in their own languages. They gathered together and Peter shared with the people about salvation in Jesus. Many people (3,000!) believed in Jesus that day and they gathered to study the Word, eat together and pray (verse 42). God did miracles through the apostles and ”… continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved” (v.46-47).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus fulfills His promises\n- THe Holy Spirit is God\n- The Holy Spirit gives power to share about Jesus\n- Jesus is Saviour of all peoples\n- Jesus forgives sin\n- Jesus is our joy\nApplication: |\n  Jesus gave believers His Holy Spirit just as He promised. The Holy Spirit gave the believers power to witness about Jesus. This passage talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I see that Jesus wants to pour out the Holy Spirit on each believer. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus and not to people. The Holy Spirit helps people to understand that Jesus is Saviour, God and King. John 16:8-11 also explains the work of the Holy Spirit.\n  __Jesus, fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to share with people about You. Thank you that You are my help. Just as you gave Peter words to share with people, please give me words when I need them. Help me to rely upon You.__\n  Jesus created and builds the Church. The Church is a group of people who love Jesus and follow Him. I am a part of the Church when I believe in Jesus and fellowship with other believers. People that are part of the Church not only read the Bible, pray but they also love Jesus and one another by sharing their lives with one another. Believers often gather together with one another. Others see our lives and how we love Jesus and one another. Often they want to know Jesus too after they see this love. __God, bless our church and save even more people through us.__\n\n  *Teachers: Please show the children on the map where these events took place and from where the different people gathered in Jerusalem came.\n"}</script>

Hallelujah!”\nSummary: |+\n  1 Chron. 16: after David brought the ark to Jerusalem, he put it in a tent. Verse 4 says, “David appointed some of the Levites to be ministers before the ark of the Lord, to celebrate the Lord God of Israel, and to give thanks and praise to Him”\n  Ps. 42, 44-50, 73-85, 87-89 are by these Levites in charge of worship (Asaph, Heman, Ethan, and the sons of Korah).\n\n  2 Chron 7:6 says that David made special instruments to praise the Lord.\n\n  Other Psalms of praise:\n  Ps. 145:8-9 “The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and great in faithful love. 9 The Lord is good to everyone; His compassion rests on all He has made.”\n\n  147:3 “He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.”\n\n  Ps. 150:6  “Let everything that breathes praise the Lord.

He used to play on his harp when he was a shepherd (1 Sam.16:19-23) and here he encouraged many others to praise God in song.  In the psalms, I see that creation and all people praise God. I can sing songs to God or play on an instrument or simply say that I love God. I can draw Him a picture or write a list of all the reason that I love Him. I can remember His great deeds, that He did during the Bible times and that He now does in my life and the lives of others. I praise God that He saved me. He is great and worthy of praise. When I’m sad or disappointed, I can remember who God is and praise Him for all that He has done, is doing and will do. Praise Jesus!!!\n\n  *Korah’s rebellion is detailed in Num. 16, when this Levite didn’t want to submit to God’s instructions on which of the Levites would serve the Lord in specific ways. All those who rebelled were punished by the Lord, but it’s wonderful to see that many generations later, the sons of Korah were joyfully praising the Lord in song and leading others in worship.\n"}</script>

They helped him to stand on his feet and he started to walk and praise God. Everyone saw that the man who couldn’t walk before was healed. Peter preached to the people about Jesus and said that Jesus healed the man and that He died, rose again and forgives the sins of those who believe in Him (verse 19).\n\n  In chapter 4, the priests and other leaders didn’t like it that Peter and John were talking about Jesus and the resurrection. They put them in prison. But many people heard about Jesus and around 5,000 people believed! In the morning, Peter and John answered that Jesus healed the man and that “… there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved”(v. 12). The leaders forbid them to speak about Jesus, “But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” (v. 19-20). The leaders let them go and the believers gathered to pray that God would continue to give them boldness “and when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.” (v. 31)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Healer\n- The Holy Spirit gives boldness and wisdom to speak about Jesus\n- Jesus is our Help\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is only Saviour\nApplication: |\n  Peter and John saw the man in need on their way to prayer. They gave the man what they could: the good news about Jesus! Jesus can help people. When I see people’s needs, I can tell them that Jesus can help them. A crowd of people saw how the crippled man was healed. Peter and John didn’t want glory for themselves but told everyone that Jesus healed him. They told them about salvation in Jesus. 5,000 people believed because they told the truth (Acts 4:4). I want to give the glory to Jesus when He does something good in my life and the lives of others. I want to tell the truth about Jesus so that people would believe in Him.\n\n  Peter and John knew that the leaders of their city recently crucified Jesus. They put them in prison for their faith in Him. Maybe they thought that the leaders wanted to kill them like they killed Jesus. But in the morning, when the leaders spoke with them they spoke about Jesus with boldness. The leaders weren’t happy but didn’t kill them. Peter and John loved Jesus and wanted to tell the truth about Him. Maybe they were scared but Jesus by the Holy Spirit helped them. Jesus helps me by the Holy Spirit too. When I’m scared, I can ask for help from Jesus to tell the truth even when people won’t like it. Peter and John prayed to God for help to speak with boldness about Jesus. __Jesus, please help me to be bold and to speak the truth about You.__\n\n  *Teachers: Please show the children on the map where these events took place.\n"}</script>

He is the Holy One.(see Acts 13:35)\n  Ps. 22: speaks about what Jesus experienced on the cross.

I believe that Jesus is God and that God had a plan from eternity to send Jesus to earth to die for my sin and to rise again. 1 Pet. 1:20-21 says, “He was chosen before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the times for you 21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.” I believe that the whole Bible is true and speaks of God’s plan of salvation for people through faith in Jesus. I believe that Jesus is King and that He reigns now in heaven (and in the hearts of those who love Him). One day, He will return and will reign on earth. I want Him to be King of my heart and of my life today and forever. I want to tell my friends and relatives about salvation in Jesus. I want to pray for those who don’t believe in Jesus, that He would become their king.\n  *note Messiah means anointed one. Kings were often anointed with oil to show that they were chosen to reign.\n"}</script>

But the Holy Spirit showed Peter that they acted dishonestly. Ananias and Sapphira lied to God and the Lord took their lives. All the people who heard were scared.\n  In verses 12-16 God healed many people through the apostles. Believers gathered near the temple and new people joined them and believed in the Lord Jesus.\n  In verses 17-42 Some of the temple leaders didn’t believe in Jesus and were envious of the apostles and put them in prison. But God sent an angel at night to open the prison door and tell them, “Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.” (v. 20) They went to the temple and started teaching people about Jesus. When the leaders sent for them in prison, the apostles weren’t there, although the doors were locked! They found them in the temple and took them again. Peter shared about Jesus with them but they wanted to kill them. However, one wise teacher said that if their teaching was from God, then is wasn’t worth it to stand against them but if it wasn’t from God, that in time, it would all come to an end. Then the leaders ordered that the apostles be beaten and let them go, forbidding them to teach people about Jesus. “So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His  name. 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.” (v. 41-42)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God knows all hearts\n- He knows everything and everyone\n- He heals\n- God wants people to come to Him\n- The Holy Spirit gives power, wisdom and boldness to speak about Jesus\n- Jesus is Savior\nApplication: |\n  Ananias and Sapphira wanted to hide the truth and give the impression that they were generous. God showed everyone that it is impossible to trick God. God knows everything that I do. I don’t want to hide anything from God. __Jesus, help me to be honest.__\n  The believers gathers in a place where everyone could see them and join them, so that they could be healed, hear about Jesus and fellowship with believers. I don’t want to hide my faith in Jesus but I want to fellowship with people about Him, so that they would also be joined to the Lord.\n  The leaders put believers in prison because of envy! They wanted people to respect them and didn’t want Jesus to be glorified. They wanted to stop the work of God, but they couldn’t. Maybe the apostles were afraid when they were in prison but God was with them and helped them. When the angel freed them, they didn’t run home to hide. They were obedient to God and went to the temple to teach about Jesus. The Holy Spirit gave them boldness and wisdom. When people threaten me for my faith in Jesus, I can ask for help knowing that the Holy Spirit (God) will give me the necessary words and guide me. __Jesus, help me to share with people about You.

Some people wanted to argue with Stephen but they couldn’t fight with him because he answered wisely. They decided to say bad things about him so that the leaders would kill him. When they judged him, his face was like that of an angel’s. Stephen told them the history of Israel, how God saved them and how they worshipped Him. He told them that they weren’t being obedient to the Holy Spirit and that they killed Jesus, the Just One (Righteous One). The leaders stoned Stephen but Stephen saw Jesus standing in heaven and he said to Him, “Lord, do not charge them with this sin.” and he died. The believers buried him and cried. Saul had approved of his death and started persecuting believers in Jesus. They were driven out of Jerusalem and started to live throughout Judea and Samaria.

He served people in the church and wasn’t afraid to share with people about Jesus. Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, gave him the words that he spoke to his accusers. Jesus was near to Stephen when he suffered for his faith in Him. God helped him to love his enemies even when they threw rocks at him. Because he wasn’t afraid to share about Jesus and die for his faith, other believers also continued to share about Jesus and many people were saved.\n  Jesus also gives me the Holy Spirit so I can wisely and lovingly share with people about Him. Sometimes people don’t want to hear what I say about Jesus. Jesus gives me love for them even when they may wrongly accuse me. He is with me when I’m having a hard time.

God did many miracles through him. A certain sorcerer named Simon believed and was baptized (Acts. 8:13). Later, Peter and John came from Jerusalem and prayed for the Samaritan believers, that the Holy Spirit would fall upon them (Acts 8:16). Simon offered money to have the power of the Holy Spirit and Peter answered, “Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!  21 You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God.  22 Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.  23 For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity” (Acts 8:20-23). Peter and John returned to Jerusalem and preached in many villages on the way (Acts 8:25).\n  An angel of the Lord told Philip to go on the road to Gaza, which was empty (Acts 8:26). On that road, Philip saw an Ethiopian in a chariot and the Spirit told Philip to go up to him. He heard the Ethiopian reading the prophet Isaiah’s words. Philip asked him if he understood what he was reading. The Ethiopian asked him to explain the passage. “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him. Now as they went down the road, they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “See, here is water. What hinders me from being baptized?” Then Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God” (v. 35-37). The Ethiopian was baptized and was glad. Then God took Phillip and he appeared in another city. He shared with people about Jesus and went to Caesarea.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Good News\n- Jesus is Saviour of all people\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- The Holy Spirit speaks and directs us\n- God is worthy of obedience\n- God knows everything\n- Jesus fulfills prophecy\nApplication: |\n  Philip told people about Jesus everywhere. He was ready to listen to the Holy Spirit. I also want to tell people about salvation in Jesus. I also want to be obedient to God when He tells me to do something. Maybe Philip didn’t understand why God wanted Him to go down an empty road but he trusted God and went. God knew that the Ethiopian was there reading scripture and seeking the truth. Philip was given the privilege of telling the Ethiopian about Jesus.\n  Philip knew the Word of God well and helped people to see what the Word says about salvation in Jesus. I also want to know the Bible so that I can know Jesus better, love Him more and tell people about Him. See also:  2 Tim 4:2, 1 Pet. 3:15 about being ready to share about Jesus.\n  Philip was a Jew and the Ethiopian was from a different people group. Philip knew that Jesus is the Saviour of all people. I know that Jesus is Saviour of all peoples and I want to share about Him not only with people from my group but with all those that God wants me to share with.\n  The Ethiopian was seeking God. He didn’t know about Jesus but he knew that the Word of God was important and he worshipped God. God revealed Himself to him and he came to know Jesus! He was ready to be baptized when he saw water. He wanted to show his faith in Jesus and identify himself with the death and resurrection of Jesus to show that he received forgiveness from Jesus and that by His grace he was given new life (see Rom. 6:1-11). Have I been baptized? If not, do I want to be baptized?\n  __Jesus, I want to know you more. Help me to understand Your Word, to grow in my love for you and to worship You with my life.

He didn’t take many horses for himself (see Deut. 17:16).\n  Ch. 9: David looked for a relative of Saul and Jonathan’s whom he could help and show mercy. Earlier, David promised Jonathan that he and his family would always be friends. He found Jonathan’s son, Mephibosheth, who was crippled. David invited him to always eat at his table and promised to care for him.\n  Ch. 10: David sent his servants to offer their condolences to the king of the Ammonites when he heard that the king’s father died. However, the king was rude to David’s servants and this started a war between them.

Jesus helps me to keep my word when I promise to do something.\n  God gave David and Israel victory over their enemies when they followed Him. Jesus wants to give me victory over sin that is my “enemy” in my life. Maybe that “enemy” is a bad habit or a harmful desire.

He went to Damascus with a letter to arrest all the believers in Jesus. On the road there, a light from heaven shone on him. “Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” Then the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.It is hard for you to kick against the goads.” So he, trembling and astonished, said, “Lord, what do You want me to do?” Then the Lord said to him, “Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do” (v. 4-6). He was blind and couldn’t see for 3 days.\n  God told Ananias to go to Saul. He was afraid, “But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel” (v. 15). He went to pray for Saul and God opened his eyes. Saul was baptized and was with the believers and started to teach in the synagogue that Jesus is God and Saviour. Then some people didn’t agree and wanted to kill him. The believers there, “took him by night and let him down through the wall in a large basket.” (v 25). Later, Saul was in Jerusalem and people didn’t believe at first that he was a follower of Jesus. But Barnabas befriended him. Saul continued to tell people that Jesus is God and Saviour and again people wanted to kill him. His friends sent him to Tarsus (his hometown, verse 11).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God and Saviour\n- God calls us\n- God has a plan for our lives\n- Jesus changes hearts and lives\nApplication: |\n  Saul (later Paul) didn’t believe in Jesus and wanted to stop believers in Him. People were afraid of him because he was mean and hurt believers in Jesus. But God had a plan for his life and He saved Saul. Do I know someone who is angry towards believers in Jesus? Do I believe that God has a good plan for that person’s life and can save him? God can!\n  Even though Ananias was afraid to go to Saul, he was obedient when God called him to go to him. God let Ananias see His big work in Saul’s heart! Does God want me to talk about Jesus with someone?__ Jesus, help me to be obedient when you call me to share about You.__\n  Jesus changed Saul! He can change me and other people. At first, Saul told everyone that Jesus was neither God nor Saviour. Later, he told everyone that Jesus is God and Saviour. Some people were angry at Saul when he talked about Jesus but he continued to share. Jesus, give me boldness and wisdom to share about Your salvation and love with people. Saul was living his own way until Jesus changed his heart. Later when Jesus led his life, he travelled a lot and told lots of people in the world about Jesus. I don’t want to live life my way.

David acted deceitfully so that Uriah would die in the war. David did evil in the eyes of the Lord.\n  Ch. 12: God sent Nathan to David to convict him of his sin. David repented before God (see Ps. 51). God forgave David but said that there would be consequences for his sin (v. 10-14). The son of Bathsheba and David got sick. David fasted; God took the child to be with Him. Later, David and Bathsheba had a son, Solomon, and God loved him.\n  Ch. 13: David’s son, Amnon did evil against his sister, Tamar.

Absalom returned and only after 2 years saw his father, David.\n  Ch. 15: Absalom acted deceitfully and “stole” the hearts of Israel. He took over David’s kingdom. Some people who had served David, decided to serve Absalom. Some people remained faithful to David. David left Jerusalem with his people (see Ps. 3).\n  Ch. 16: When David left Jerusalem, certain people treated him poorly. Absalom entered Jerusalem. One of David’s counselors, Ahithophel, was on Absalom’s side.\n  Ch. 17: Ahithophel, told Absalom how to fight against David, but David’s friend, Hushai, gave different advice that saved David.

He didn’t fear God when he took Uriah’s wife and killed him. Maybe David thought that no one saw him, but God saw everything. God punished David because He loved him and wanted David to return to Him. David repented. God was very merciful to him, in that He didn’t kill David. David broke God’s commands. When David returned to God, He forgave him. Later, there were many problems in David’s family because he had taken many wives and didn’t raise his children right. During David’s suffering because of his sins and mistakes, God helped him. He is faithful and merciful.\n  I want to fear God, that is, respect God and be humble before Him. He is a great King and He is worthy of obedience. When I sin, I am not respecting, loving or fearing God. Sometimes one wrong, selfish decision leads to many problems. Jesus is always ready to forgive my sin and change my heart, but I need to understand that sin is harmful and dangerous and wounds me and those around me. Jesus, help me __to see dangerous situations and to seek to fulfill Your will and not my own. Remind me of examples from the Bible, so that I would turn to You and give you glory with my life. Help me to love You and Your Word. Help me to respect You above all.__\n  The end consequences for people who live for their own glory and don’t fear God is frightening and sad (Amnon, Absalom, Ahithophel, Sheba). God doesn’t want me to continue to live my way. That’s why He disciplines me, so that I would follow Him, love Him and in the process become more like Jesus.\n"}</script>

God sent an angel to him and told him to call Peter. Peter was a Jew and didn’t socialize with Gentiles. God showed him a vision when he prayed and said, “What God has cleansed you must not call unclean” (v. 15). Peter didn’t understand, but when people from Cornelius came looking for him, God told Peter to go with them.\n  Peter and some other Jewish believers went to Cornelius’s house where many people (Gentiles) were gathered. Cornelius wanted to bow to Peter, but he raised him up and said “I also am just a man.” Cornelius wanted to hear a message from God. Peter understood that he should share with them about salvation in Jesus and that they weren’t “unclean Gentiles” but were people that Jesus wanted to save. When he shared about Jesus, the Holy Spirit came down on the Gentiles because they believed in Jesus. Peter and his friends were amazed that God gave the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit, just as He had given them. Then they were baptized in the name of Jesus.\n  In Chapter 11, the Jewish believes in Jerusalem heard that Peter was with Gentiles and started to be upset. But Peter said that God saved them and gave the Gentiles the same gift that He had given the Jews on the day of Pentecost, that is, the gift of the Holy Spirit.  Having understood this, the Jews rejoiced that God also saved the Gentiles. Because of persecution of believers in Jesus, some people went away to Antioch, where then many people turned to Jesus and so a church began.\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour of all peoples\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is a gift for every believer in Jesus\n- God cleanses those who were unclean\n- God hears prayer\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\n- God is merciful\nApplication: |\n  Cornelius didn’t know much about God but worshipped Him and God heard his prayer and sent Peter to tell him about salvation in Jesus. The Jews thought that salvation in Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit was only for them but God showed them that salvation and the gift of the Holy Spirit is for every person who believes in Jesus. Cornelius invited many people to his house so they could hear from God. God saved many people that day when they heard about Jesus. Like Cornelius, I too want to seek God, love Him and invite people to hear about Jesus. I want to trust Jesus and worship Him. From this passage, I know that salvation in Jesus is for all who believe in Him!\n  Peter didn’t understand God’s plan right away. He didn’t understand the vision he saw, but he was obedient to God when He sent him to Cornelius. Later, Peter understood that God wanted to save the Gentiles. Sometimes when I pray and read the Bible, I don’t understand everything but God shows me what to do. Jesus, help me to do what your Word says and trust You even when I don’t understand everything. Peter told the people about Jesus and God saved them and poured out His Holy Spirit on them. I believe that today God wants to save people and use me to tell them about Jesus. __Jesus, show me who to share with and how to do it. Fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to tell people that You are the only Saviour!__\n  In the Bible, I see God’s plan to save everyone. He gave His Law to the Jews and made a special covenant with them. He always wanted them to be a light to other nations so that the nations would see that God is the only true God. He sent His Son Jesus to the Jews. Jesus was a Jew and fulfilled God’s Law that the Jews knew. It was always God’s plan that all believers in Jesus would be saved and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

The previous king, Saul and his sons had killed Gibeonites, whom the Israelites had promised to protect. The Gibeonites asked for the death of those who had done that wrong (1-14). David and his army killed the enemy (15-22).\n  Ch. 22: David sang a song to God.\n  Ch. 23: Songs of praise (v. 1-7). David had many brave warriors who fought well.\n  Ch. 24: David decided to count the people in his kingdom even though he wasn’t suppose to do that. He repented. The prophet Gad said that God gave David a choice between 3 consequences for his sin. David chose to fall into the hands of God, because He is merciful (v. 14). God killed many people in Israel. David saw an angel of the Lord and asked God for mercy. God told David through the prophet Gad to build an altar in a certain place. David bought the place, built an altar and offered sacrifices to the Lord. Then the Lord stopped striking the people.\n  1 Kings 1: David was old and his son Adonijah made himself king. David’s army commander Joab supported him. But the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother, spoke with David. David wanted Solomon to be king after him. They anointed Solomon and the whole city celebrated. Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, but Solomon said that if he would act rightly, he wouldn’t kill him.\n  Ch. 2:1-12: David commanded Solomon to follow God and to punish his enemies.\n  1 Chron 22, 28-29: David told Solomon to build the temple. He told the Israelites and Solomon to follow God. He gave Solomon plans and treasures for the temple. David prayed to God before the whole assembly of people.\n  see also Ps. 2, 30, 37, 62, 103, 109, 131\n  *Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them.

He trusted God and loved HIm. There were moments in David’s life when he didn’t trust God and sinned. There were consequences for his sin and he repented before God. I want to follow Jesus. When I don’t love God and sin, I desire to turn to Jesus right away for forgiveness and help to do what is right. God showed David mercy and fulfilled His promises to him in that his son reigned after him and there was always someone from his house who could sit on the throne. I know that Jesus was born from the line of David and that God fulfilled His promise to David through Jesus.\n  God said that David was a man after his own heart (Acts 13:22). I want to be a person after God’s own heart. __Jesus, help me to trust You in everything, today and till the end. Thank you, that You are faithful to help me, lead me and strengthen me.

The church was praying for him. “And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands” (v.6 -7). The angel led Peter out of prison. Peter went to Mary’s house (the mother of John-Mark) where the believers were praying for him. At first, they didn’t believe that Peter came to them and then they were astonished. Then Peter went to a different place.\n  Herod was prideful and died.

Thank you!__\n  The church didn’t know what God’s plan was for Peter but they prayed for him. I don’t always know what God wants to do but I can pray for others. I can pray with believers.

Song of Solomon: The aspiration\n  for union with Christ'\nScripture: 1 Kings 2:13-1 Kings 4, 2 Chron. 1, Ps. 72, Song of Songs 8:6-7\nTruth: God gives wisdom to those who ask\nVerse: James 1:5 “Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to\n  all generously and without criticizing, and it will be given to him.” or 1 Kings\n  8:23 “Lord God of Israel, there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth below,\n  keeping the gracious covenant with Your servants who walk before You with their\n  whole heart.”\nSummary: |+\n  2:13-46: Solomon acted wisely towards the people who didn’t support his kingship.\n  Ch. 3: God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, “Ask. What should I give you?” (v. 5). He asked God for wisdom because he was young and didn’t know how to lead the people. God was pleased with his request and God gave Solomon more wisdom than other people. He also promised to give him riches.\n  Once, 2 women came to Solomon for judgement of their argument about to whom a baby belonged. One of the women lied. Solomon gave the order to cut the child in half but the real mother didn’t want her child to die and was ready to give him to the other woman whereas the other woman wanted him to die. Then Solomon knew who the real mother was and gave the baby to her. The people all saw the wisdom that God gave Solomon.\n  Ch. 4: God gave Solomon riches, glory and wisdom. There was peace in the land. “Solomon composed 3,000 proverbs, and his songs numbered 1,005. 33 He described trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing out of the wall. He also taught about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 34 People came from everywhere, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, to listen to Solomon’s wisdom” (v.32-34).\n\n  Ps. 72 (possibly David’s prayer for his son, Solomon)\n\n  Song of Songs 8:6-7: Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death; ardent love is as unrelenting as Sheol. Love’s flames are fiery flames— the fiercest of all. 7 Mighty waters cannot extinguish love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all his wealth for love, it would be utterly scorned.”\n\nCharacter:\n- God is wise\n- He knows what I need\n- He controls everything\n- He is generous\n- Jesus is the Eternal King\n- God is holy\n- God is righteous and judges rightly\n- God knows all hearts\n- God is King\n- He is glorious\n- God is faithful and fulfills His promises\n- God is rich (in mercy, love and strength)\n- Jesus is the Groom and His Church is the Bride (seen in Song of Songs)\n- Jesus loves His Bride\nApplication: |\n  I can ask God for wisdom and know that He will give it. Jesus, helps me to live pleasing to God and to not compromise. I don’t always remember what is right, but God knows and His Word tells me what is right. God knows what is in my heart and in the hearts of others. I should fear the Lord (respect and revere Him).\n  Solomon wrote the Song of Songs which talks about the deep love between a husband and wife. We can understand this as a picture of Jesus and the Church. Jesus loves us so much that He gave His life for us.\n  Solomon loved God but didn’t always follow Him. Even at the beginning of his reign, he allowed things that weren’t pleasing to God. See Deut. 17:14-17. Later, there were big problems. He 1) married a woman that didn’t worship God alone (1 Kings 3:1). 2) multiplied horses (1 Kings 4:26) and 3) gathered many riches (10:14 and 21).\n  I understand that it’s easy to start to love God but I need His help to remain faithful. __Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to live and give me a heart that is ready to do what You teach me to do. Protect and guard me from the temptation to 1) love those that don’t love You more than I love You 2) trust in my own strength and not in You 3) find my security in riches instead of in You. Holy Spirit, help me to know and do what is pleasing to God and to express my love for Jesus. Teach me, when I read the Word, so I can know and fulfill what is wise and share God’s wisdom with people.__\n"}</script>

They sent them off and they traveled and shared with people about Jesus. They went to Cyprus and shared about Jesus on the whole island. There was a false prophet there, who was against the Good News. God blinded him for a time; people saw the miracle and believed in Jesus and the Word.\n  Then they sailed to Pamphylia and shared in the synagogue (where the Jews read the Old Testament) and Paul preached Jesus and explained that the Old Testament talks about Jesus. Some of the Jews believed and even the Gentiles believed, “And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region“ (13:49). Then some unbelieving Jews drove Paul and Barnabas away. They continued on their way, “And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit“ (13:52).\n\nCharacter:\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus is God\n- He is Saviour of all\n- The Holy Spirit speaks\n- He sends believers out to fulfill His plan\n- God directs\n- Jesus fulfills prophecy\n- He is alive\n- He is Savior\n- He fills believers with joy and the Holy Spirit\nApplication: |\n  The believers in Antioch prayed and worshiped God. The Holy Spirit spoke to them and told them what to do, so they prayed for Paul and Barnabas and sent them off to fulfill God’s calling. I also can pray with believers and hear from the Holy Spirit. Today also, God sends people from the church to share about Jesus with people who still haven’t heard about Him. I want to be obedient to the Holy Spirit and share with people about Jesus in my homeland and beyond it’s borders and even to the ends of the earth. I want to support (in prayer etc.) those whom God sends out for missions from my church.\n  When Paul and Barnabas shared about Jesus, some people believed in Him and others didn’t. Some became a part of the church (a group of believers in Jesus) and others wanted to stop them and kick them out. There will always be different reactions (responses) towards Jesus. I know that Jesus wants to save everyone but not everyone will love Jesus. People who don’t love Jesus also won’t love me. It’s important that I know: Jesus loves me and loves them. That’s why I want to tell people about Him. People without Jesus will perish (die without hope) but God doesn’t want people to perish. __Jesus, help me to share about You.

It was big and beautiful. Many people over many years built the temple. God spoke to Solomon and warned him to follow Him (v. 11-13).\n  Ch. 7: Solomon built his house. Hiram made everything that was needed for ministry in the temple.\n  Ch. 8: When the temple was finished being built, all the people gathered to worship God. They brought the ark of the covenant into the temple. Inside the ark were the tablets with the 10 commandments. The priests offered sacrifices to God and the Lord’s glory filled the temple. Solomon prayed to God and thanked Him that He fulfilled His Word to the people. He commanded the people to always follow God and asked God to answer their prayers in the temple. The people celebrated for 7 days.\n  Ch. 9: God again spoke to Solomon and said that He heard his prayer. He warned Solomon to follow Him and said that the temple would be destroyed if the people walked away from God (v. 1-9). In 2 Chron. 7:14, He promised that if “ My people who are called by My name humble themselves, pray and seek My face, and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.”\nCharacter:\n- God is worthy of worship\n- He has authority\n- Everything belongs to Him\n- God is Holy\n- God is our help\n- God speaks and warns\n- God blesses, forgives and heals\nApplication: |\n  Today I don’t need to go to a temple to worship God. Believers in Jesus are themselves considered a temple of God (see 1 Cor. 3:16-17). Jesus gives believers His Holy Spirit, who lives in my heart (when I believe in Jesus). I can praise and worship God with my life. I can give (commit) my life to Jesus and become God’s “temple” (a place where His glory and His presence dwell, where He is worshiped). I can pray to God and know that He hears me. God warned Solomon and wanted him to love Him and follow Him. God also speaks to me through the Bible and wants me to love Him and follow Him.

The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles wanted to stone them but they left and went to Lycaonia. In the city of Lystra, Paul healed a crippled man in the name of Jesus. People thought that Paul and Barnabas were gods and wanted to sacrifice to them. But Paul explained that there is only one God who made heaven and earth and that they should worship Him. Then the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles stoned Paul. The believers prayed for him and he got up and continued on. In every place they prayed and fasted that God would show them who should be leaders there. They later returned to the church in Antioch, from which they were sent out.  “Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles” (14:27).\nCharacter:\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus is God\n- He is Savior for all\n- He heals\n- The Holy Spirit guides believers to fulfill His plans\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- Jesus is the only Savior for all people\n- God is unchanging\nApplication: |\n  People often change their minds. I myself often change my opinion. We, people, are changeable. I am glad that God never changes! At the beginning of the story, people had wanted to worship Paul and Barnabas as gods and then after a little while they were ready to kill them! I trust God and not people because we, people, don’t always act right and don’t always understand correctly. __Jesus, please give me patience and wisdom when people don’t understand what I am telling them about You.

God will help me and promises to give me wisdom and strength in every situation. God doesn’t tempt me but He sometimes tests me so that I would trust Him more and rely upon Him. God always has good intentions for my life. Jesus gives me wisdom to know how to live and follow Him. He helps me to listen to others and know what to say and not get angry. He gives me love for others and shows me how to fulfill what His Word says (for example to help widows and orphans and to live a pure life).\n  I know that we people are all the same before God. That is, Jesus died for the poor and the rich and sees everyone the same. I also should treat all people with the same love and respect. I shouldn’t judge others or discriminate against them because I myself am imperfect. Only Jesus is perfect. By His mercy, Jesus paid for my sin and this is why “mercy triumphs over judgment.” When I believe in something or someone, my belief is manifested through what I do. Abraham and Rahab believed in God and I see their faith through what they did. My actions don’t save me. Only the perfect life of Jesus and His sacrifice on the cross saves me when I believe in Him and start to trust Him. Now because of my faith in Jesus, I want to live pleasing Him. He gives me strength and wisdom through the Holy Spirit and the Word to daily follow Him. __Jesus, please give me wisdom and love to endure trials, to be strengthened in faith and to love everyone as You love, through my life (in all that I do.)__\n"}</script>

I need Jesus’ help to control my tongue. Jesus said that my words come out of my heart, “But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart.” (Matt. 15:18). Only Jesus can give me a new heart that loves God and others. When He changes my heart, He changes my life. __ Jesus, give me a humble heart that depends upon You for life, love and wisdom. Jesus, give me wisdom that brings righteousness. Teach me to be wise, Jesus, and to not seek my own, but to seek what is pleasing to You.__\n  When I don’t get what I want, I should examine the motives of my heart and look at my life. Am I living in a way that is pleasing to God? Do I have right desires and relationships with people? If Jesus shows me that there is a desire or action that is displeasing, I should repent and humble myself before God. He loves when I come to Him for help and He promises to draw near to me.\n  God doesn’t want me to say bad things about others, especially believers. I myself am not perfect. Only Jesus is perfect and has the right to judge people. If I judge someone, I am saying that I’m higher than God’s Law. Jesus, thank you for Your mercy and salvation. I humble myself before You. I want to trust Jesus with my life, desires and dreams. __ Jesus, give me a heart that trusts you in everything.__\n  In chapter 5, James warns the rich who are trusting their riches and aren’t treating others right. I don’t want to trust in riches or abuse authority over people because that is not pleasing to God. Jesus, help me to have a right attitude towards money, knowing that everything belongs to You. All that You give, I want to use rightly, in a way that is pleasing to You. James also writes to those who are suffering and wants them to continue to trust Jesus, knowing that He is coming soon. __Jesus, help me to know, that Your arrival is at hand (soon). Help me to trust You and have expectation in Your Heavenly Kingdom and not in a material kingdom for myself here on earth. __\n  God hears the prayers of the righteous. Who is righteous before God? Jesus is my righteousness. When I humble myself before God and recognize that only Jesus is righteous that that His righteousness saves me, then He imputes to me His righteousness and I become righteous before God. Only through Jesus, can I be righteous in God’s eyes. Then, through faith in Jesus, God hears my prayers. __Thank you, Jesus, for Your righteousness, for Your salvation.

They heard that some of the believing Jews told the believing Gentiles that they should keep the whole law if they wanted to be real believers in Jesus (Gal 1:6). Paul wrote a letter to the believers in Galatia so they would remember that all people are saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in His righteousness and not by keeping the law (which is impossible). Only Jesus (who is God and man) fulfilled the whole law (Rom. 8:3-4). Paul wrote, “knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified” (Gal 2:16). Believers understand that Jesus fulfilled the whole law and  gives them new life. “For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. “ (2:19-20).\n  Abraham was justified by faith and God gave him the promise, “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, “In you all the nations shall be blessed: ”9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.” (3:8) Jesus died for us “that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” (3:14) The Law was given after Abraham and acted as a “harsh tutor” that showed us that we couldn’t be perfect in our own strength. Now, we are not under Law because Jesus already came. “For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (3:26-29)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- He fulfilled the whole Law\n- Jesus gives believers in Him new life\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- Jesus unites believers with Himself\nApplication: |\n  Jesus saves me and everyone who believes in Him by grace. Trying to fulfill the law doesn’t save me. I am wrong if I think that God will accept me if I do good works. God accepts those who put faith in the perfect life, sacrifice and victory of Jesus. I trust the righteousness of Jesus and not my “righteousness”. When I believe in Him, by grace, He forgives my sin and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit, who lives in me and helps me to live pleasing to God.\n  __Jesus, I believe that my salvation is through Your righteousness. Help me to tell others that You are the only Savior, the One who fulfilled the Law, lived a perfect life, gave Your life as a perfect sacrifice, died and rose again to justify me and all those who believe in You.

Against such there\n  is no law.”\nSummary: |\n  In chapter 4, it says that God gives believers the Holy Spirit who helps us to understand that God has adopted us. Believers can call God their Father and know that they will inherit eternal life. (4:6-7) Paul gave an example from the Old Testament about Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael, the son of the slave woman,  represents the Law which doesn’t lead to relationship with God. He was brought forth by the law, through works. Isaac, the son of the free woman, represents the promise of God, which leads to relationship with God according to grace through faith. (4:22-24) All believers in Jesus are like the children of the free woman.\n  In Chapter 5, Paul writes that believers should walk in the Spirit (that is, follow Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit). Jesus gives us power to live God’s way through the Holy Spirit (5:16) “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.” When a person belongs to Jesus (through faith in Him), he won’t live according to his selfish desires but will live by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit (v.24)\n  In Chapter 6, he writes that believers don’t boast in their deeds or in how they fulfill the law which doesn’t save them. They boast in Christ Jesus and in what He accomplished on the cross (6:14).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- He fulfilled the whole law\n- Jesus gives believers new life\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God gives love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness\n  and self-control\n- The Holy Spirit helps believers to live God’s way\n- God adopts people\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- Jesus gives believers the Holy Spirit\n- Jesus gives believers right desires\n- Jesus is the Victor\nApplication: |\n  The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. When I love Jesus (and He helps me to love Him), then just like an apple tree that grows apples, so my life (and my heart) will be filled with love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. I can ask Jesus to grow the fruit of the Holy Spirit in my life and that I would love Him and others more and more.\n  What does the fruit of the Holy Spirit look like? What do these look like:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? What examples of each one can I think of? Jesus is God and He showed us all of the fruit of the Spirit. Which examples from the life of Jesus can I remember that are examples of:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? Do I believe that Jesus can help this fruit to grow in my life? He wants to help me. I can ask of HIm. __Jesus, please fill me with Your Holy Spirit and grow the fruit of the Spirit in my life. Help me to live pleasing to You and to love You.__\n  Paul warned believers to not try to come to God through the works of the law. I can only come to God through faith in Jesus Christ, trusting in His righteousness. This is why I boast in the cross. “But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.” (6:14) On the cross, Jesus died for my sin and paid for my iniquities. There, He conquered sin and death. He rose again and gives me forgiveness and new life in the knowledge of HIm. I don’t want to live like the world lives. People want to show that they are right. I want to live pleasing to Jesus, so that people would see that He is right. He is the Loving Victor who makes us God’s children by His grace and not according to my works. I want to be a part of God’s family and tell people that they also can become God’s children through faith in Jesus.\n\n  *Teacher!

He took many wives. His heart turned from God and the Lord was angry with Solomon. He told him that he would take the kingdom away from his son.

Paul and Barnabas didn’t agree and were sent from their church in Antioch to the church in Jerusalem where there was a church council to discuss the question of salvation for the Gentiles (Acts 15). Peter shared about how God saved the Gentiles (Cornelius and his family) and gave them the gift of the Holy Spirit just as He gave the believing Jews. James quoted the prophet Amos, where he wrote about God’s plan to save the Gentiles. (Acts 15:16-18)  They all agreed that Jesus saves everyone by grace and that the law doesn’t save. They agreed that it wasn’t right to teach people to fulfill the law for salvation. They wrote the Gentile believers a letter where they explained this.\n  Then Paul and Silas along with Judas and Silas returned to Antioch from Jerusalem and were in the church there. The believers there rejoiced in the news in the letter. Later, Paul wanted to travel with Barnabas again and Barnabas wanted to take his nephew John-Mark with them as he did before but Paul didn’t want to take him because he had left them during their journey. Paul and Barnabas didn’t agree and decided to go their separate ways. Barnabas and Mark went to Cyprus while Paul and Silas were approved by the believers in the Antioch church to go, “and he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.” (15:14)\nCharacter:\n- God saves by grace\n- Jesus is the Savior of all peoples\n- God leads us\n- God gives the Holy Spirit to all believers in Jesus\n- God gave us the Word in order to make right decisions\nApplication: |\n  I am saved by grace and not by works. The church often struggled with incorrect understanding about salvation. Even today, people sometimes get confused. This is why I need to know the Bible and what is written there about God’s plan of salvation. The Bible helps me to resolve problems. When the Jerusalem Council was held, they discussed the work of God and the teaching of the Word about the salvation of the Gentiles. This helped them to see the truth that God saved all people by grace. Then all people had unity in the truth. Sometimes believers don’t agree with one another. It’s good to discuss problems together with believers and to look at what the Bible says about it.\n  The Church (a group of believers) sends people out to share about Jesus and supports the “sent ones”,  missionaries. Later, the missionaries returned to the church that sent them out in order to share with them about God’s work. Paul and Barnabas were sent from the church in Antioch and returned there to share about God’s work. They were missionaries. I can pray for missionaries that I know. Maybe God wants to send me as a missionary somewhere. The Holy Spirit will lead and guide me and the family of God in the church will send me and pray for me.\n  Sometimes good friends in Christ don’t agree with one another and God wants them to do different things. Barnabas, whose name means “son of encouragement” was an encouragement for Mark in his faith, just as he had encouraged Paul earlier (Acts 4:36, 9:26-27). Maybe Mark wasn’t mature when he left Paul and Barnabas (Acts 13) but later, Paul wrote about Mark, saying that he was a mature believer and servant in the church. Paul even called Mark his son. To read more about John Mark see: Acts 12:12, 13:13, Col. 4:12, Philemon 1:24, 2 Tim 4:12, 1 Pet 5:13. God can grow my faith. He uses people like Barnabas to help me grow in faith. Maybe in the future he will use me like Barnabas to be an encouragement to a younger believer. __Jesus, I want to know You better and love You more. Help me to trust You. Teach me the truth of your Word and lead me by your Holy Spirit.__\n"}</script>

The people of Israel gathered to ask him to make their work easier. Rehoboam didn’t listen to the wise advice of the older people and answered the people harshly. Then, 10 of the tribes left Rehoboam and became the northern kingdom (Israel). Rehoboam remained king of the southern kingdom (Judah). In Israel, Jeroboam became king.\n  Ch. 13: Jeroboam sinned and made 2 golden calves in Israel (one in the north and one in the south) for people to worship God and not go to Jerusalem. But God sent him a prophet who said that this was wrong. The prophet was supposed to home right away by a different road but he listened to a deceitful person and stayed for a little while. Because of his disobedience, he died on the way home.\n  Ch. 14: Jeroboam’s son was ill and he sent his wife to a prophet to know if he would get better. The prophet said that God judged Jeroboam for his disobedience. In Judah, the people started to worship different gods and God was angry. This was an abomination to the Lord. Also, Pharaoh came to Jerusalem and stole their treasures.\n  2 Chron 12:1-2: “When Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power, he abandoned the law of the Lord—he and all Israel with him. 2 Because they were unfaithful to the Lord, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt went to war against Jerusalem”\n  2 Chron. 12:6-8 “So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “Yahweh is righteous.”7 When the Lord saw that they had humbled themselves, the Lord’s message came to Shemaiah: “They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them but will grant them a little deliverance…However, they will become his servants so that they may recognize the difference between serving Me and serving the kingdoms of other lands.”\n\nCharacter:\n- God is King Eternal\n- God is Holy\n- God is Judge\n- God is merciful\nApplication: |\n  God wants me to worship Him alone. He is the most important and not me or other things that the world considers important. If God gives me a responsibility, I need to trust Him and follow Him in fulfilling it and not try to do things my own way. The kings of Judah and Israel influenced the spiritual lives of the people in their kingdom. I also influence the people around me. When I am trusting Jesus and following Him, things will be better for me and the people around me. __Jesus, help me to worship You with my life and to point to You and Your goodness, strength and wisdom in all I say and do.

(Acts 16:1-6). In the city of Lystra, they met Timothy. He fulfilled a Jewish ritual (circumcision) that he didn’t do earlier because his father was a Gentile but his mother was Jewish. “Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. 7 After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them” (Acts 16:6-7)\n  God gave Paul a vision of a man in Macedonia. Paul and Silas traveled to Macedonia and were in the city of Philippi (v.12). There, a lady named Lydia and her family believed in Jesus (v.14-15). They all gathered at the river, where they prayed (v.13). Once, on the way there, they met a demon-possessed servant girl. Her master used her to make money (the demon in her would tell fortunes/guess people’s future). The girl followed Paul and the others saying “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation” (v.17).  After hearing this for many days, one day Paul drove the demon out of her in the name of Jesus Christ. The master of the girl was angry because he couldn’t make money using her anymore and complained to the leaders of the city about Paul and Silas. They beat them and put them in prison.\n  At night, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praise songs to God and all the prisoners heard them. Then there was an earthquake and the doors of the prison opened. The jailer wanted to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had run away. But Paul stopped him. The jailer wanted to know how to be saved. Paul and Silas said “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” (31) The jailer led them out and, his whole house heard the Word of the Lord, the jailer washed Paul and Silas’s wounds and his household believed in Jesus and was baptized. Then they ate. In the morning, the city leaders released Paul and Silas from prison. Paul said that they put them in prison unjustly and asked that the leaders come themselves to lead them out of prison. Then Paul and Silas went to Lydia’s house, to the believers in Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- God is worthy of praise\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus gives freedom\n- God is wise and kind\n- Jesus gives joy amidst trials\nApplication: |\n  Paul, Silas and the others traveled to tell people about Jesus. I also can look for people who don’t know about Jesus, to tell them about His love and salvation. Where can I share about Jesus? In school, at home, on the street, at the playground and even in other countries.\n  Paul and the others met a demon possessed servant girl. In the name of Jesus, she was freed from the demon. Only Jesus can free a person. He is God and He controls everything. People who don’t believe in Jesus are under the control of sin and satan. They don’t know what true freedom in Jesus Christ is. I can tell them that Jesus wants to give them forgiveness and freedom. Only through faith in Jesus can a person be free from sin and the influence of satan (who is a fallen angel and is lower than Jesus because Jesus is God).\n  For their act of kindness, Paul and Silas were put in prison! I may think that people in prison aren’t free but because Paul and Silas were believers, in their hearts, they were free and they could be joyful and sing songs to Jesus. The others heard them. When I suffer unjustly, I can still be joyful because I know that Jesus is with me. Even when I am suffering, I can praise Jesus and those around me will see that Jesus is my help, my strength and my joy.\n  God opened the doors of the prison. Through this miracle, Paul and Silas could share about Jesus with the jailer and his household. They all heard the Word of the Lord and believed in Jesus. People need to hear the truth about Jesus from the Bible. I can share with them what I know about Jesus from the Bible. I can tell them that only through faith in Jesus, we are saved.\n  To be in prison because of my faith in Jesus seems scary. But I see how everything works for good. That is, because Paul and Silas were in prison and sang songs to Jesus, the jailer and his family heard about Jesus and God saved them! I don’t always understand how God works, but I can trust Him. I believe that He is wise and kind and that He has a good plan for me and others. __Jesus, help me to be joyful in You always and tell people that You are the Great Saviour! When I’m in a hard situation, help me to remember that you work all things for good!__\n\n  Note: If a question arises regarding Timothy’s circumcision (16:3), it’s important to teach that he wasn’t circumcised for salvation, because we just studied that keeping the law cannot save. He did this because he wanted to minister to the Jews. To become fully a Jew, he had to be circumcised. He did this for the sake of ministry and not for the sake of salvation.\n\n  *Teacher!

He sinned against God.\n\n  Ch. 16: God told the prophet Jehu that He would destroy Baasha’s family for their idol worship.

She worshiped false gods and did many bad things.\n\n  Chapt. 17: Israel’s kings and the people didn’t follow God. He sent the people his prophet, Elijah, who spoke God’s Word to them. Elijah told king Ahab that there would be no rain in Israel for 3 years because of the king’s disobedience. Then God told Elijah to go east and live by a river, where there was water. God commanded the ravens to feed Elijah. They brought him bread and meat each morning and evening until the river dried up. Then God sent Elijah to a different city where they didn’t know about God and He promised that there, a widow would feed him. He found the widow there and asked for food. She was very poor and said that she couldn’t feed him because she needed to make bread for her son with her last bit of flour and oil. But God said that the flour and oil wouldn’t run out and she agreed to feed Elijah. God did a miracle and the flour and oil did not run out. Later, the widow’s son got sick and died. She told Elijah and he asked God to raise him to life. God gave the boy life! The widow began to believe in God.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is faithful, caring and loving\n- God knows everything\n- God is almighty\n- God gives life\n- God is holy\n- God is our help\n- He is king\n- He makes known His will\n- He is the Living God\nApplication: |\n  God took care of Elijah and the widow. He will also take care of me. God sees my needs. He led Elijah to the river and then to the city where the widow lived. God was glorified (shown to be great and good) in Elijah’s life when God fed him and helped the widow. Jesus leads me to places where He can  be glorified in my life.\n  When I follow Jesus, I see that he cares for me even when He calls me to do something that is unpopular (i.e. Elijah spoke to king Ahab). I can trust God even when I have very little of something or when my situation seems hopeless (i.e. the widow). I can share what I have with others and know that all  I have is from God. God does everything for His glory and for my good. When I trust God, it helps others to see that He is great and helps them start to trust Him. __Jesus, thank you that You care for me. Use my life, that others would see how caring and wonderful You are.__\n"}</script>

He has given assurance of this to all by raising\n  Him from the dead.”\nSummary: |-\n  Paul, Silas, Timothy and others were in Thessalonica. There, Paul preached about Jesus in the synagogue for 3 weeks. Some believed in Jesus while others were jealous that the Gentiles started to believe. The non-believers stirred up problems and as a result, the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea where people studied the scriptures carefully. (17:10-11) They received the truth. Later, wicked people from Thessalonica came and so Paul traveled on further to Athens and waited for his friends. He was sad to see the city full of idols. He spoke with people about Jesus and they invited him to share in the Areopagus (a place in the city where they discussed different teachings and philosophies). Some people laughed and others believed when he spoke about the resurrection of Jesus.\n   Later, Paul went to Corinth. He met and worked with Aquila and Priscilla. He preached about Jesus when his friends came from Macedonia, “And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized. 9 Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, “Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent; 10 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.” 11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.” (18:8-11) The unbelieving Jews wanted to accuse Paul in court but they were unsuccessful.\nCharacter:\n- God is the Only God\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God guides believers\n- God is with us\n- God fulfills His promises\n- God is a Defender\n- Jesus is God\nApplication: |\n  I see that according to Scripture, the Good News about Jesus is for all people, in any place, in any culture, in any time. He is the only Savior, independent of what people believed before or knew about God. Some people believed when Paul and his friends told about Jesus. Some people were really against them and started big problems in the city. But their reaction didn’t change the truth that Jesus is the Only Savior. When I share with people about Jesus, I can expect that some will believe in Jesus and some will not. I should remember that Jesus is with me and that He gives me His Holy Spirit in order to know what to say and how to act and how to love people. In Athens, there were many idols and people loved to discuss different ideas, religions and philosophy. This happens today as well. People are searching for the truth or just love to be distracted by different ideas. __Jesus, help me to share with people so that they would know that You are the only Savior. Give me boldness to love them and wisdom to know what to say that they would turn to You.__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

Yahweh, He is God!”\nSummary: |+\n  There had already been drought in the land for 3 years. God told Elijah to return to Israel and talk with king Ahab. He gathered all the people and the prophets of Baal (a false god) on Mount Carmel. He said that they would see who the true God is. The people who worshipped Baal would bring a sacrifice to him and Elijah would sacrifice to God. The one who answered the sacrifice with fire from heaven was the true God. The prophets of Baal cried out to him all day long but nothing happened. Then Elijah gathered the people near the altar, dug a ditch around it and poured water over the altar 3 times until the water filled the ditch. He prayed to God and asked Him to show the people that He is the Only God. God answered with fire from heaven and all the people fell on their faces and cried out “the Lord, He is God!” Then they killed the false prophets.\n\n  When Jezebel, the wife of king Ahab, heard that the prophets of Baal had been killed, she was angry with Elijah and sent him a message that she wanted to kill him. Elijah got scared and ran away to the south. He wanted to give up and die but God sent an angel who fed him and strengthened him to walk 40 days and 40 nights to Mount Horeb (Sinai). He found a cave and there heard God’s voice asking him “what are you doing here, Elijah?” He told God that he was the only believer and that he was scared for his life. God showed him a mighty wind, earthquake and fire but the Lord was not in those things. Then there was a soft whisper. God again spoke to Elijah and asked “what are you doing here, Elijah?” Elijah answered the same as before. God sent Elijah north to anoint kings in Syria and Israel. He also wanted Elijah to anoint Elisha to be prophet in his place. God also told him that he wasn’t alone but that there were still 7 thousand people in Israel who had not worshiped the false god, Baal. Elijah found Elisha. Elisha left his old life to follow God’s calling.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is the living God\n- God is Holy\n- God reveals Himself\n- He alone is worthy of worship\n- He is Jealous\n- God knows everything and sees everything\n- He alone is God\n- He is caring\n- He is omnipresent\n- He guides history\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God is mighty\n- He has all authority\nApplication: |\n  I know that God is the Only God and the One way of salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ. God used Elijah to show people that He is God. He can use even me to show people that Jesus is God. Even if I am the only one in a crowd of people who believes in Jesus, I can be sure that God is with me and He alone is worthy of worship.\n  Elijah felt scared and alone when Jezebel threatened him. God took care of Elijah and spoke to him. Elijah wanted to give up and die, but the Mighty God who miraculously sent fire from heaven on Mt. Carmel and showed Elijah the wind, earthquake and fire spoke to him in a still quiet whisper. He gave Elijah new instructions for continuing to love and serve Him with His life. He reminded Elijah that he really wasn’t alone. Jesus is near to me when I am scared and feel alone. He provides for all my needs. He speaks to me through His Word, by His Spirit. He is the Mighty God of Wonders and yet He is the Good Shepherd who leads me to quiet waters and restores my soul. __Jesus, thank you, for Your constant presence with me, for Your great love and care. Help me to trust You. Thank you that just like Elijah, I can go to be with you all by myself and You are near to me and speak to me. Strengthen me to continue to walk with you all of my days.

Other people there drove Paul and Silas out of town. The believers there were an example of faith for other believers in their region. They “… turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 10 and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.\n  Paul wrote that they had come to Thessalonica from Philippi where they had been imprisoned for their faith in Jesus (Acts 16:22-40). Believers in Thessalonica suffered because of their faith at the hands of their people, just as Jesus suffered at the hands of the Jews (2:14). When Paul was waiting in Athens (Acts 17:15), Timothy went to Thessalonica in order to find out how the believers there were doing (3:1). Timothy passed on to Paul that the believers were standing in their faith in Jesus and Paul rejoiced. He wanted to go there and to strengthen their faith (3:10). Paul prayed for them, “Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you. 12 And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we do to you, 13 so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints“ (3:11-13)\n  Paul wanted the Thessalonian believers to live pure and pleasing to God, “For this is the will of God, your sanctification… “ (4:3) That is, that the believers would live in holiness and in love. Paul explained what would happen in the end times, and told them not to worry when believers died. “…For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.” (4:16-18)\n  Paul wrote that the Day of the Lord will come unexpectedly and that, “…God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. 11 Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.” (5:9-11)\n  He taught them, “Rejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies. 21 Test all things; hold fast what is good. 22 Abstain from every form of evil. 23 Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.“ (5:16-24)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- He will return\n- God sanctifies believers\n- He is a God of peace\n- Jesus is Lord\n- He is worthy of obedience\n- God is Holy\n- God is the Heavenly Father\n- Jesus suffered\n- Jesus conquered\n- The Holy Spirit gives joy\n- God is true and living\nApplication: |\n  I know that Jesus will return for me. The Day of the Lord will come, when God will judge all those who don’t believe in Jesus. He will not judge believers because they trusted Him for salvation and received Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross. __Thank you Jesus for salvation! Help me to tell others about You, so that they will not perish.__\n   Just as the believers in Thessalonica experienced difficulties because of their faith in Jesus, I too will experience difficulties because of my faith in Jesus. But I know that Jesus is with me and He helps me to rejoice and to live in holiness and in love. The Thessalonian believers were an example for other believers.__ Jesus, help me to be an encouragement for other believers when I trust You in everything and wait for You.__\n\n  *Teacher!

A prophet came to king Ahab and said that God would give him victory. He did. In the spring, the Syrian king again came against Israel, thinking that God couldn’t help Israel if they fought in a field. God again sent a prophet to say that God would give them victory, so that Israel would know that He is God. However, King Ahab made a mistake and didn’t kill the king of Syria. God showed Ahab through a prophet that now he would die because he didn’t do what God had wanted. Ahab went home resentful and angry.\n  Ch. 21: There was a vineyard near Ahab’s house that belonged to Naboth. Ahab wanted to buy it but Naboth didn’t want to sell it. Ahab was upset and his wife, Jezebel made a plan to take Naboth’s vineyard. She invited evil people to a banquet with Naboth. The evil people said bad things about Naboth and killed him. Then, Ahab took the vineyard. Later, God sent Elijah to Ahab and said that God would judge Ahab’s family and that they would die for their evil deeds and idol worship. But Ahab humbled himself before God. God decided to fulfill His prophecy against Ahab’s family after his death.\n  Ch. 22: After 3 years, the kings of Israel and Judah fought against the king of Syria. King Jehoshaphat of Judah wanted to know God’s will. There were different “prophets” who spoke what king Ahab wanted to hear. The king of Judah wanted to hear from God and not from people. The prophet Micaiah, who spoke the truth was there. Ahab didn’t like him because he didn’t like to hear what he said. Micaiah said that Ahab would die in battle that day. Having heard the prophecy, Ahab disguised himself in battle. During the battle, someone shot an arrow without aiming and it happened to hit Ahab so that he died, just as God had said. After than, his son Ahaziah, who worshiped false gods, reigned. What he did was wrong in God’s eyes.\n\nCharacter:\n- God sees and knows everything\n- God knows all hearts\n- God is Judge\n- God speaks through His Word\n- God has all authority\n- God is Holy, Honest and Pure\nApplication: |\n  God wanted Ahab to get rid of the enemy when they attacked Israel. I can think of sin as my enemy. Selfishness and  pride, for example are enemies that attack my heart and mind. Do I try to befriend these enemies of my soul or do I ask God to help me to fight against them. Lord God, is there something in my heart that is not pleasing to You and Your Holiness? Jesus help me to “kill” that which is not pleasing to Him. If I don’t fight against sin in my life, in the end, sin will kill me.\n  Ahab was greedy when he wanted Naboth’s vineyard. Is there  greed in my heart? Jesus can forgive me and change me. Jezebel didn’t value Naboth’s life and helped to kill him in order to get what she wanted. Have I ever acted like that by not caring about someone else and hurting them in order to get what I wanted?\n  The prophet Micaiah shared God’s Word with people even though people didn’t like to hear what he said. Am I ready to tell the truth even when others want me to agree with a lie.__ Jesus, help me to live and speak in a way that is pleasing to You.__\n"}</script>

They were an example of faith for other believers. At the time, they were suffering because of their faith in Jesus but the judgement day will arrive when Jesus will repay with tribulation those who trouble them. (1:6) Paul writes that nonbelievers “…shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, 10 when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed.” (1:9-10)\n  Paul writes about the last days because they thought that the Day of the Lord had already happened. He writes that first the antichrist will come who will call himself god and then Jesus will come and destroy him. (2:8) Paul wants the believers to stand firm in the truth that they learned (2:15). He asks the believers to pray for the going forth of the Word and for God to rescue them from evil men. He says that they should be hardworking and not lazy. (3:12)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- Jesus will avenge\n- God is Judge\n- Jesus is Comforter\n- He fulfills His promises\n- He is glorious\nApplication: |\n  I know that Jesus will return and punish those who are against Him and believers in Him. I know that then, I will be with Him forever and I will see Him face to face. I am waiting for His return! This will be a joyous day! Now I may have difficulties when unbelievers say bad things about me or treat me rudely because of my faith in Jesus. Jesus comforts me and gives me strength to continue trusting Him, to love people and to have joy in Him.\n  Paul asked the Thessalonians to pray for the spreading of the Word and for protection from evil men. I also pray that more people would hear the Word and believe in Jesus. I also pray that God would protect missionaries and believers from evil men when they share the Word. Jesus, help me to not be lazy but to live for You and for Your glory every day so that many people would know You and be with You in Your Kingdom when You return.\n  For unbelievers: Maybe I am not sure if Jesus saved me. What should I do? Can I be sure that Jesus forgives my sin and saves me? The Bible says that I am a sinner and that I deserve punishment for my disobedience to God. I have a broken relationship with God and I need to be reconciled with HIm. Jesus reconciles me with God. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God (He is God), who lived a perfect, sinless life and laid His life down on the cross to take my punishment upon Himself, then He will forgive me. By His mercy and grace, He saves me. I don’t trust my own righteousness (which really isn’t righteousness!) but I trust in Jesus’ righteousness and His sacrifice for me. He changes my heart and gives me new life in the knowledge of Him. He gives me the Holy Spirit who lives within me and teaches me and leads me. Jesus is in me and I am in Him! I don’t live for my own desires, but I already live by faith in Jesus Christ.\n  When I trust Jesus, all of His promises are for me and I am certain that I have become a child of God. Thank you Jesus for Your great love! Thank you for forgiveness and new life in You. I love You and submit to You.\n  “That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.“ Romans 10:9\n  “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. “ Gal. 2:20\n"}</script>

He send teachers and priests throughout the land to teach people God’s Word. God was with Jehoshaphat. He had riches and power.\n  Ch. 18:King Jehoshaphat’s son married King Ahab’s daughter (2 Kings 8:18, 2 Chron 21:6). Jehoshaphat wanted to hear from God’s prophet when they prepared to fight the enemy together (see 1 Kings 22).\n  Ch. 19: God told Jehoshaphat that He was angry that he had joined with Ahab in war because Ahab did not love God, but God was pleased that Jehoshaphat wanted to seek Him. The king again went through the country to set up godly judges and priests and bring people close to the Lord.\n  Ch. 20: When the enemy came against his land, “Jehoshaphat was afraid, and he resolved to seek the Lord. Then he proclaimed a fast for all Judah, 4 who gathered to seek the Lord. They even came from all the cities of Judah to seek Him.” They gathered in the temple court and the king prayed and asked God to help them. They bowed to the ground and praised the Lord in song (v.18-19). In the morning, they went out to battle and were singing praises, “Give thanks to the Lord, for His faithful love endures forever” (v. 21.). The Lord made their enemies fight against one another and they destroyed each other. Judah’s army gathered plunder from their defeated enemies for 3 days. They rejoiced that God gave them victory,  “So they came into Jerusalem to the Lord’s temple with harps, lyres, and trumpets” (v. 28). God gave them peace in the land.\n  Jehoshaphat made an alliance with Ahab’s son Amaziah to made ships. But God told him through a prophet that it was wrong to be united with Amaziah, who didn’t love God and that the ships would be broken up. It happened just as God said.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is worthy of praise\n- God fights for His people\n- God is the Victor\n- God is mighty\n- He speaks to His people\n- He rebukes and blesses\n- He gives peace and protects\nApplication: |\n  Jehoshaphat was one of Judah’s good and godly leaders. He led the people well and taught them to know God’s Word and walk in God’s ways. Because of this, there was peace in the land and God gave them miraculous victory over their enemies. The people praised God with music and the Lord defeated their enemies. When I praise God in song, I can think about the words and what I am saying about God. I can express my love and trust to God through music. He is worthy to be praised!\n  Twice, Jehoshaphat made alliances with kings in Israel that didn’t love God. Those kings did many wicked things and God did not want Jehoshaphat to join with them. Jesus, help me to be wise about with whom I join. God was faithful to tell Jehoshaphat when he had done something wrong.  __Lord Jesus, please help me to listen and follow You when you correct me. You are a great Savior and You are worthy of praise!__\n"}</script>

Along the way, he stopped in Ephesus and they asked him to stay longer, but he declined, saying that if it was God’s will, he would return to them. He was in Antioch and later went back to the regions of Galatia and Phrygia (modern day Turkey) to strengthen the disciples (18:23) Aquila and Priscilla were in Ephesus. They met Apollos and helped him to better understand the truth about Jesus. The brothers there encouraged him when he decided to go to Achaia and share about Jesus there.\n  Later, Paul came to Ephesus and shared with people about Jesus. They had never heard of the Holy Spirit and didn’t know about the baptism of Jesus. They were then baptized in the name of Jesus and also received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Paul taught about Jesus in the synagogue for 3 months but then people opposed him and he gathered with the disciples in the school of Tyrannus for 2 years. Many Jews and Gentiles heard about Jesus there. (19:8-10)\n  God did many miracles there and healed people. There were some people who didn’t trust Jesus who wanted to cast demons out of a man. The possessed man beat them. Everyone was afraid and the believers decided to burn their magic books. “So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.” (19:20)\n  Paul decided to travel on, but before he left, “…about that time there arose a great commotion about the Way“ (19:23) Demetrius and others who made silver idols didn’t like Paul teaching people to worship the living God and not idols. Their business suffered and Demetrius stirred people up so that they gathered in the stadium and yelled “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!“ (19:28) They yelled for a long time and only the city clerk could quiet the crowd. After this, Paul said goodbye to the disciples and left for Macedonia. (20:1)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Only God and Savior\n- He defends His own\n- He cleanses hearts\n- Only Jesus is worthy of worship\n- The Holy Spirit fills believers\n- Jesus teaches us about Himself\n- The Holy Spirit leads and guides believers\n- Jesus has authority over everything and everyone\nApplication: |\n  I can always know more about Jesus and love Him more. Apollos knew about Jesus, but Aquila and Priscilla taught him more about Him. Just like Apollos, I can share with people about Jesus. Paul told believers in Ephesus about the Holy Spirit. Do I know about the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is God. He fills and overflows believers in Jesus. He gives me strength to witness about Jesus (Acts 1:8). He teaches me and guides me. Often in the book of Acts, I read about how the Holy Spirit showed believers where to go or gave them wisdom to share about Jesus. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit.\n  I know that Jesus has authority over everything and everyone. I submit to Him. People wanted to drive demons out in the name of Jesus, but they themselves didn’t know Jesus. The demons submit to Jesus and not to people. They submit to Him because Jesus is God and He is Almighty. Believers in Ephesus saw that only Jesus is worthy of worship and this is why they burned their magic books that were not pleasing to Him. __Holy Spirit, show me if there is anything in my life that is not pleasing to You, so that I would remove it and be sanctified unto You.__\n  Paul taught for a long time in Ephesus. As always, there were people who believed in Jesus and those who didn’t. __Jesus, help me to share with people about You and not grow weary when some people don’t want to love You and follow You. Help me to love You and follow You, no matter what.__\n  Demetrius was angry at Paul and his teaching when people stopped buying his idols. He started a riot. Even today, there are people who for the sake of money or power cause problems for believers. I worship Jesus and won’t spend money of that which is not pleasing to Him. Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to act when unbelievers are acting against me and other believers. Despite these events, Paul didn’t stop sharing with people about the only Savior, Jesus! __Jesus, lead me also and help me to share with people about You. You alone are Savior.

Ch.2)\nTruth: God gives eternal life\nVerse: 'Jn. 6:40 “For this is the will of My Father: that everyone who sees the Son\n  and believes in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”'\nSummary: |+\n  Ch. 1: King Ahaziah of Israel fell and wanted to find out his fate from a false god but God sent news to him through Elijah that he would die. The king sent 50 soldiers to go get Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill. They commanded him to come down. Elijah said, ““If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your 50 men.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his 50 men” (v.10). This happened a second time. The third time, the soldiers asked for mercy and God told Elijah to go down with them. Elijah told the king that he would die because he didn’t believe in the Living God.  According to God’s Word, it happened. Elijah wrote a letter to King Jehoram in Judah (son of Jehoshaphat) to tell him that because he acted wickedly, he would get sick and die (2 Chron. 21:1-20).\n  Ch 2: God was going to take Elijah to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah traveled to different cities and wanted to leave Elisha but Elisha wanted to stay with him. Many of God’s prophets said goodbye to Elijah, knowing that God would take him to Himself. Elijah and Elisha miraculously crossed the Jordan river. Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him before he left. He said that he wanted a double portion of his spirit. Elijah answered that if he saw him when he was taken, that it would be so. As they were walking together suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and took Elijah up in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it and cried out “my father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel” Then Elisha crossed over the river in a miraculous way again and the other prophets saw that the spirit of God was upon Elisha. They searched for Elijah for 3 days even though Elisha said that it was useless.\n  Ch. 3: King Joram (also spelled Jehoram) of Israel wanted to fight along with the king of Judah (at the time Jehoshaphat was still king) and the king of Edom against Moab. They were in the desert for 7 days and couldn’t find water. They thought that they would die. The king of Judah wanted to know God’s will for them and asked Elisha the prophet to ask God. A musician played music and God said that He would give them water and victory over Moab. In the morning, God gave them water. From far away, the sun on the water looked like blood and the Moabite king thought that the armies of the 3 other kings had killed each other. They came to the camp of the 3 kings and fought, but God gave the 3 kings victory over Moab.\n  Ch. 4: The Holy Spirit was upon Elisha. Once, a widow asked him for help. She needed money to pay a debt so that her children wouldn’t be sold into slavery. Elisha told her to find as many jars and containers as she could. She found many. Then the prophet told her to pour oil into them. The oil\n  miraculously kept flowing until the last jar was filled. Then the widow sold the oil to pay her debt.\n  Elisha went to a city where a certain family often helped him. He asked God to give them a child. After a few years, the boy got sick and died. The mother traveled to Elisha but didn’t say that her son had died. Elisha quickly came to the boy and prayed that God would return his life. Several times, he prayed and God gave the boy life! God raised him from the dead.\n  Elisha was with other prophets and their food was inedible. He put some flour in it and then everyone could eat it. One man brought 20 loaves of bread to the  group of 100 prophets. God did a miracle and when they ate, everyone there had enough to eat and there was bread left over.\n\nCharacter:\n- God knows everything\n- He sees all\n- He is caring\n- He is everywhere (omnipresent)\n- God controls history\n- God has a plan to take His own to be with Him\n- God is Holy Spirit\n- God is mighty\n- God has all authority\n- God protects\n- God is the Only God\n- God provides\n- He is a God of miracles\n- He is wonderful\n- He hears our prayers\n- God loves to do the impossible\n- He is glorious\n- He is caring\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He is the Victor\nApplication: |\n  Only God knows everything (false gods and people don’t know) and I can ask Him for wisdom and knowledge and pray to Him. Jesus protects me from evil. When I believe in Jesus, I know that he will take me to be with Him in heaven. I believe that God knows my needs and hears my prayers. I can ask God for help. He cares for my needs. I can ask Jesus to help the needs of others.\n  Earlier, Elijah had been so discouraged that he asked God to take his life. He wanted to die. But God had a better plan for Elijah’s life. He took him up to heaven to be with Him! This is a good example of how we can be thankful when God doesn’t always give us what we ask for!\n  Before Elijah was taken up to God, Elisha asked for God’s Spirit to be upon him (2 Kings 2:9). God answered his prayer and did many miracles through Elisha. Through these miracles, God blessed and cared for people in amazing ways. God can use ordinary things (flour and oil) and ordinary people (Elisha, you and me) for His glory, so that people would see that He is great! Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to believers to help them love God and tell others about Him. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit and to be glorified in my life (Lk.11:13).\n  God raised the boy from the dead. This reminds me of Jesus. Jesus brings life from death. He rose from the dead and He gives life to those who are dead in sin and promises to raise believers from the dead (Rom.8:11). That is  great miracle! He showed His great love for us when He died for us, so that we can have life in Him.  There are many people around me who are spiritually dead. __Jesus, help me to tell them about the life that you can give them!__\n\n  Scriptures for further discussion about God taking us to be with Him and being with Jesus in heaven:\n\n  1 Thess. 4:13-18” But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.”\n  Rev 22:4 ”They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads”\n  Job 19:25-27 ”For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; 26 and  after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God, 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!”\n"}</script>

Silas and Timothy came later. (Acts 18). Paul taught there for 1 ½ years. (Acts 18:11) Later, when Paul was in Antioch and Galatia, Apollos also taught people in Corinth. Paul was thankful to God for the Corinthians’ faith in Jesus. He wrote the Corinthian believers that they should have unity and not division between them. Some learned the truth about Jesus from Paul and others from Apollos. Later, the people were divided and boasted about their teachers but really, they all belonged to Jesus. “But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption— 31 that, as it is written, “He who glories, let him glory in the Lord. “ (1:30-31)\n  Paul explained that God gives wisdom from the Holy Spirit that is not like the world’s wisdom. Believers have the mind of Christ. (2:16) The Corinthian believers weren’t acting wisely or spiritual. Paul wrote that Jesus is the most important, “ For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. “ (3:11) The apostles were only people. Paul said, “Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. “ (4:1) He wanted them to be humble.\n  Paul heard that some of the believers there were sinning in their relationships and boasting about it. “ But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner—not even to eat with such a person. 12 For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? 13 But those who are outside God judges. Therefore “put away from yourselves the evil person.“ (5:11-13)\n  Paul didn’t want believers to act like unbelievers and bring each other to court. Before their repentance, they had been in their sin and guilty before God, “And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.“ (6:11)\n  Believers should live in purity. “ Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.“ (6:19-20)\n  In chapter 7, Paul wrote about purity in relationships for those who are married and for those who are single. in chapter 8, he wrote that believers should love and respect one another and not hurt one another.\nCharacter:\n- God is Holy\n- Jesus is Savior\n- He is our justification, wisdom and sanctification\n- The Holy Spirit dwells within believers\n- Jesus the the foundation of faith\nApplication: |\n  My faith in Jesus changes how I live. I want to remember that whoever my mentor or teacher in the faith was, I should boast in Jesus Christ alone. He is the Author of my salvation. He is God. I respect those who teach me the Word but they are only God’s servants. We all should be humble before God and one another.\n  Sometimes there are people who call themselves believers but they live in sin and act worldly. The Bible says that I shouldn’t live in sin like the world. I shouldn’t have close fellowship with believers who are living in sin until they repent. God doesn’t want His people to live for themselves. His Holy Spirit lives in me and I am the temple of God. A temple is a place where God is worshiped. I want to worship God with my body, mind, actions and words. Jesus, be praised in all that I do (study in school, play with friends, help at home, fellowship with people).\n  Paul wrote the Corinthians because he wanted them to become mature in Christ. He told them things that were difficult and not pleasant to hear. But he told them out of love for them. maybe someone will tell me that I’m not quite living according to the Word.__ Jesus, help me to be humble in heart. Help me to submit to You and to the Word. Help me listen to the Holy Spirit and do what You tell me to do or stop doing what is not pleasing to You. __\n  Sometimes, I am just reading the Bible (for example the letter to the Corinthians ) and God Himself convicts me through His Word. Jesus, teach me and change me that I would always be ready to hear from You. Help me to love You and others from a pure heart with my words and actions.\n\n  *Teacher!

Freely you have received,\n  freely give.”\nSummary: |+\n  Ch. 5:Naaman was a famous successful soldier in the land of Israel’s enemies but he had a terrible skin disease. Once, he took captive a girl from Israel and she served  his wife. The girl shared about a prophet in Israel who could help Naaman. The king of Syria wrote a letter to the king of Israel about Naaman but the king of Israel didn’t know how to help him and was upset. The prophet Elisha heard about it and said that Naaman could come to him. Naaman came to Elisha on his chariot with lots of people and expensive gifts but the prophet didn’t even come out of his house to meet him and told him to wash 7 times in the Jordan river.\n  Naaman was upset and had expected different help. He didn’t want to do what Elisha said but his servant said, that really what the prophet told him to do wasn’t hard. The prophet told him to wash and that then he would be clean and healthy. Naaman washed 7 times and on the 7th time, according to the Word of God, he became clean! He wanted to give Elisha a lot of presents but Elisha wouldn’t take anything from him. Naaman said that now he would only worship God. After this he started on his way home but Elisha’s servant Gehazi caught up to Naaman and lied to him so that he could get some presents from him. He got the gifts and hid them but God showed Elisha what Gehazi had done and put on him the skin disease that had been on Naaman.\n  Ch. 6: God made an axe head float, to help the man retrieve it from the river. God told Elisha the enemy’s position so as to warn the king of Israel. The enemy came to get Elisha and surrounded his city and his servant was afraid. “Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.” 17 Then Elisha prayed, “Lord, please open his eyes and let him see.” So the Lord opened the servant’s eyes. He looked and saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha” (17-18). God made the enemy blind and Elisha led them to Israel’s king. The king fed them and sent them away. Later, there was a famine in the land and the king was angry with God and wanted to kill Elisha.\n  Ch. 7: God promised to help the people the next day but one man didn’t believe. Elisha said that this man wouldn’t take part in the blessing. God used 4 lepers to find the enemy’s camp, where God had already driven them away. The lepers told their city about the treasures and God blessed the city, but the man who didn’t believe was trampled by the crowd at the gate. As God said, he didn’t partake of the blessing.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Healer\n- God sees everything\n- God is merciful\n- God is glorious\n- God shows us His glory\n- God is the Lord of all people\n- God freely gives us His grace\n- God has an army that defends His people\nApplication: |\n  God showed grace and mercy to Naaman. He freely healed him. Elisha didn’t take gifts from Naaman so that he would understand this about God. Jesus freely saves me by His grace. I can’t do anything to deserve or earn His kindness. I can follow Elisha’s example and help people without expecting anything in return. I can follow the little girl’s example and tell people about the greatness of my God. I can also follow Naaman’s example and come to God for healing from sickness and for cleansing from sin.  But I better not follow Gehazi’s example, being sneaky and greedy. This is sin. God sees everything and I can never trick Him. When I sin, I can ask forgiveness from Jesus and ask Him to help me to be honest, loving and giving.\n"}</script>

But whether\n  there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease;\n  whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away.”\nSummary: |-\n  Paul wanted to share the gospel with everyone and that’s why he made himself a servant (slave), so that more people would be saved (9:19). He gave an example of a person who is running a marathon for a prize. Believers live with their eyes on the heavenly destination, thinking about Jesus, who is our prize. (9:24-27) Believers shouldn’t worship idols but run from idol worship. Jesus helps us to run from temptation (10:13) “Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.“ (10:31) Paul wrote that Jesus is the head and everyone submits to Him. He wrote about the Lord’s Supper and how it should be done in remembrance of Jesus. (11:25)\n  The Holy Spirit gives different gifts to believers. Just as there are different parts of the body the different gifts amongst believers help the body to care for itself. (12:25-26) Believers are to use all the gifts with love. (13:4-13) God wants the gifts of the Spirit to be used in an orderly manner during a service so that people are edified. (ch 14)\n  Paul wanted believers to stand in the truth about Jesus, “ that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures.“ (15:4) Certain people in Corinth didn’t believe that there would be a resurrection from the dead and Paul corrected them. “ For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. 23 But each one in his own order: Christ the first fruits, afterward those who are Christ’s at His coming. 24 Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power. 25 For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. 26 The last enemy that will be destroyed is death“ (15:22-26). Believers will receive a new immortal body when Jesus returns! “So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”[55 “O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?” 56 The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. 57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.“ (15:54-58)\n  “Watch, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong. 14 Let all that you do be done with love “ (16:13-14)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Savior of all\n- He is our reward\n- Jesus rose and He is alive\n- The Holy Spirit gives gifts for the edification of the church in love\n- Jesus gives eternal life\n- Jesus conquered death and hell\n- Jesus will return\n- Jesus is our hope\nApplication: |\n  The Corinthian believers acted in pride sometimes and that’s why Paul wrote them a lot about how to love one another during their services, when they ate together etc. Everything that I do is founded upon what Jesus did for me and I want to do everything for Jesus’ glory (10:31). I want to do everything with love. (16:14) God gives the gifts of the Holy Spirit. He wants me to use these gifts with love. What gifts does the Holy Spirit give? Why does He give us the gifts? What should I do with the gifts? __Jesus, show me how I can build up believers with the gifts that You have given me. Give me a humble heart that loves You and others.__\n   I believe that Jesus is coming and that He will receive me and give me a new immortal body. Jesu is my hope. I want to tell people about how Jesus conquered death and hell. I want to tell them how through faith in Him, they can have forgiveness from God and new life, eternal life, now and forever.\n  *Teacher!

For He is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, rich in faithful\n  love, and He relents from sending disaster.”\nSummary: |+\n  Ch. 8: God fulfilled His Word that He spoke earlier through Elijah that Hazael would be king in Syria (1 Kings 19:15). New kings ruled in Israel (Ahaziah) and Judah (Jehoram) that didn’t love God and acted like Ahab. They fought against Edom*.\n  Ch. 9: God anointed Jehu as king of Israel (according to God’s word in 1 Kings 19:16). God used Jehu to judge Ahab’s family, as He said He would.\n  Ch. 10: Jehu killed all those connected with Ahab (even the king of Judah) and also, in a sneaky way, he killed all those in Israel who worshiped Baal . However, he didn’t follow God in his heart (v.31).\n\n  * Obadiah: God speaks a word of judgement against Edom. He judged them for their pride (v.3)\n\n  Joel: The prophet talks about a famine in the land and disobedient people. Locusts ate up everything in the land. God calls people to repentance (2:13), speaks of the last days (2:29-32),  promises to pour out the Holy Spirit (2:28) and says that He will judge the nations (3:12).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is a Righteous Judge\n- He is King\n- He is a jealous God\n- He fulfills His Word\n- ' God communicates His truth'\n- He is gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, right in faithful love and relents\n  from sending disaster (Joel 2:13)\nApplication: |\n  The time came when God judged Ahab’s house for all their evil. They had done wicked things and didn’t follow God. God also spoke judgement against Edom for their pride. One day, God will punish all those who don’t love and follow Jesus. Often in Scripture, the day when God will judge everyone is called: The Day of the Lord. In the book of Joel alone, the phrase “the Day of the Lord” appears 5 times. When I believe in Jesus and trust Him, I don’t have to be afraid of punishment (1 Jn. 4:17-19). He took my punishment upon Himself on the cross. He takes away the sin of all those who trust in HIm. This is good news! __Jesus, please help me to walk with you all of my days and to love you with all of my heart. Help me to tell others about you, to warn them about judgement and to tell them the good news, that You can take away their sin and guilt. Thank you for your faithful love and compassion. __\n\n  1 Jn. 4:17-19 “In this, love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, for we are as He is in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love because He first loved us.”\n\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.\n"}</script>

(1:3-4) He told the church to forgive and love the repentant person who had sinned earlier. (2:7-8) God enables believers to live for Him and share the gospel. “ Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (3:17-18) We preach Christ. People in the world are blind and can’t “see” Jesus, but God can open their eyes, that they would see Jesus’ glory. (4:6) We are weak vessels but the Holy Spirit is within us. “ Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 18 while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” (4:16-18)\n  Our bodies are temporal now but God is preparing a dwelling for us in heaven. (5:1) One day, believers will be with Him. We want to tell others about Jesus. “ For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.” (5:14-15) Believers are a new creation. (5:17)\n  Believers have the ministry of reconciliation which means sharing with people about Jesus. “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (5:21) Paul writes that believers are the temple of the living God and shouldn’t “Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?” (6:14)\n  In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the believers there. They were sad and repented. “For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.” (7:10) Titus was in Corinth and told Paul how the church there obeyed his correction. Paul was very glad that they humbled themselves before God.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is the God of all comforts\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God promises an eternal dwelling for believers\n- God is the Father of mercy\n- Jesus is the Redeemer\n- The Holy Spirit dwells in believers\n- Jesus changes and renews believers\n- The Lord is Spirit\n- He gives freedom\n- God makes people see Jesus\n- Jesus will raise believers\n- God is Judge\n- Jesus Himself is the good news\n- Jesus is righteous\n- God gives grace\nApplication: |\n  When I’m having a hard time, I know that Jesus is with me. He Himself suffered and understands when I suffer. He comforts me and then I can comfort others when they suffer. Earlier, Paul had written the church so that they wouldn’t  have close fellowship with people who called themselves believers but were really living a sinful lifestyle. According to Paul’s words in this letter, I understand that this person repented. Paul writes that the church should love and forgive this person. I should do the same. Jesus changes me so that I would become more like HIm. Thank you, Jesus, for Your work in my life and the lives of other believers. Thank you, that I am a new creation in Jesus. When a person sincerely trusts Jesus, God changes him. Do I see that God has changed my heart? Do I want God to change my heart, so that I would become more like Jesus? I can ask Him and He will work in my heart by the Holy Spirit.\n  I am a weak vessel, but Jesus can use my life, so that people would be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. I can be Jesus’ ambassador. I want to show people that Jesus is Savior. Jesus’ love towards me gives me the desire to tell others about Jesus. Maybe here on earth I will suffer for my faith in Jesus. Paul and the other apostles experienced a lot for the sake of the gospel. But I am sure that this present suffering is nothing compared to the glory that I will see when I am with Jesus in heaven. He promised me that I will be with Him forever in heaven and I want others to be with Jesus too.\n  When I sin and God convicts me, I want to repent quickly and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Jesus, help me to sincerely grieve over my sin and fully submit to You. Thank you for Your grace and salvation.\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

But God helped one son, Joash, to survive and he was hidden in the house of the Lord for 6 years. The priest Jehoiada then gathered the people and said that Joash was king. They killed Athalia and those who were on her side. They destroyed the place of Baal worship in Judah.\n  Ch. 12: Joash (sometimes spelled Jehoash) was 7 years old when he became king in Judah and he followed God. He ordered the people to repair the temple. His grandmother Athaliah had used things there for worshiping Baal, a false god (2 Chron. 24:7). When the king of Syria wanted to attack Jerusalem, Joash sent him treasures from the temple and from his house to make him go away. (see also 2 Chron. 23-24 for details about Joash).\n  2 Chron. 24: After the death of the priest Jehoiada, Joash listened to the leaders in Judah and started to worship false gods. By the Holy Spirit, Zechariah (son of the priest Jehoiada) said that this was wrong, but the king killed him. Later, the king was wounded in battle and his servants killed him at home. God was angry with them, “nevertheless, He sent them prophets to bring them back to the Lord; they admonished them, but the people would not listen” (v.17).\n  Ch. 13: Jehoahaz ruled in Israel. He didn’t follow God and God sent Hazael from Syria (or Aram)  to fight against him. Later, Jehoahaz turned to God and God helped him (v. 4-5). His son (also named Jehoash) fought against the king of Judah. He did what was evil in God’s sight. He visited Elisha when the prophet was dying. Elisha told him to shoot an arrow out of the window and to strike the ground with the remaining arrows. The king struck the ground only 3 times and Elisha was angry. He said that Jehoash would win 3 battles against the Syrians and not completely destroy them. Syria oppressed Israel, but God was gracious and compassionate to them and Syria didn’t destroy them (v. 23).\n\n  2 Chron 25: Amaziah reigned in Judah. He followed God. When I prophet told him not to go to battle with the soldiers from Israel that he hired, he listened and sent them home. God gave him victory against Edom. Then he started worshiping the idols of Edom. When the prophet questioned him, he didn’t want to listen. The prophet said that God would destroy him for his idol worship and disobedience. Amaziah challenged king Jehoash of Israel to fight, but Judah’s army lost and Israel’s army broke Jerusalem’s wall and took gold and silver from the house of God. Amaziah was later killed in a conspiracy. I Kings 14:25 says that the prophet Jonah spoke to the people and God helped Israel to fight for more territory. (1 Kings 14 also details Amaziah’s reign)\n\n  Amos: A little bit after the above events, during the reigns of King Azariah (Uzziah) in Judah and Jeroboam (II) in Israel,  Amos wrote this book. Amos was a shepherd (7:14-15) and prophesied that God would punish king Hazael (of Syria or Aram) along with other nations including Israel and Judah (3:3). God sent them difficulties so that they would return to Him (4:6-13). God warned that He would send them into captivity and also promised to return them to the land (2 Kings 14, 2 Chron 25).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is a jealous God\n- He is worthy of worship\n- God punished sin\n- God warns\n- God forgives\n- God is Love\n- God is Holy\n- He is the Right Way\n- He is unchanging and faithful\nApplication: |\n  Joash followed God well when Jehoiada the priest was alive. He listened to the advice of someone who loved the Lord. He also repaired the temple. However, when he was older, he listened to the advice of people who didn’t love the Lord. He did evil when he killed Zechariah.  Listening to the advice of godly people is important but it’s also important for me to know and love God for myself. Then I can stand firm in the truth even when opinions or circumstances change.\n  This was the case for Zechariah. He loved God and boldly spoke the truth. God gives me boldness to speak the truth (like Zechariah) when believers in Jesus start to walk away from Him. Even if they don’t receive my words, it’s important that I say what God tells me to say. Jesus, please give me wisdom to know what to say and how to say it. Help me to know and love you! God speaks to us through His Word. I can know God’s opinions and will when I study the Bible.\n  The book of Amos shows me that God warns us and disciplines us so that we would understand when our ways are sinful and harmful. He wants us to follow Jesus. Jesus reconciles us with God.\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.\n"}</script>

The church was preparing an offering to support other believers in their need. (8:14) “God loves a cheerful giver” (9:7)\n  Someone questioned Paul’s authority to speak to and correct the Corinthian church.He wrote,“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (10:3-5) God gave Paul a responsibility to build up believers and to not destroy their faith (10:8) False teachers came to Corinth and Paul was concerned about the believers there. (11:4) The false teachers seemed to be right but even satan can look like an angel of light. (11:13-15) Paul had many concerns for those who heard the gospel and this proved that he didn’t live for himself but for Christ, that people would know Jesus. (11:22-30)\n  God showed Paul a vision of heaven and afterwards, humbled him with a physical ailment . Paul asked 3 times for healing and wrote, “And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” (12:9-10)\n  Paul was ready to serve and love believers there even if they didn’t love and respect him. He wanted them to be edified in Christ. (12:15, 19) He planned to go to Corinth and wanted the church to trust Jesus. “ Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you are disqualified. ” (13:5)  He wanted people to live by faith in Jesus and not in sin. “Finally, brethren, farewell. Become complete. Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.” (13:11) “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.” (13:14)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus gives grace\n- Jesus is Lord\n- He is strong\n- God is Father\n- He gives love\n- The Holy Spirit gives us fellowship between people and God\n- God is a Giver\n- Jesus laid down His life\nApplication: |\n  During Paul’s time, the believers were helping one another in their need. Today also, believers all around the world support one another in prayer and materially. How can I help my brothers and sisters with their needs? I can pray for them or maybe pass on some of my unneeded clothing to them. __God, show me how to be a cheerful giver.__\n   People came to Corinth and said bad things about Paul. But Paul’s life proved that he wanted to edify believers and not ruin them. He always spoke about Jesus and wanted people to follow Jesus. There will be false teachers in churches. There will be people who will say bad things about others. My job is to hold on tight to the truth about Jesus in the Bible, check everything that they say with the Word of God and also look at the lives of those who are speaking poorly of others. Jesus, guard me from deceit. A true teacher from God will edify my faith in Jesus and not tear it down .\n  God wants me to be close to Him. He doesn’t want me to continue in a sinful lifestyle. That’s why Paul wrote, “Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. “ (13:5) __Holy Spirit, show me my heart and correct me. I want to trust Jesus in everything and live pleasing to Him. Give me Your strength, wisdom and love. I love You, Jesus.__\n\n  *Teacher!

Jonah got on a boat going the opposite direction. God sent a storm on the sea. The sailors found out that the storm was because of Jonah’s disobedience to God. He told them that he believed in the Lord God who made the heavens, the sea and the land. They were afraid of God’s wrath and did what Jonah said when he told them to throw him into the sea. Then the sea was calm and the sailors worshiped God.\n  Chapt. 2 God told a big fish (whale) to swallow Jonah and he was in the belly of the whale for 3 days and 3 nights. Jonah prayed to God and said that “Salvation is from the Lord.” The Lord told the whale to spit Jonah out on land.\n  Chapt. 3: The Lord told Jonah a second time to go to Nineveh to speak His Word there. Jonah decided to listen and told the people of the city that in 40 days, God would destroy their city. The people listened, believed God’s Word and repented. The king told people to fast and to turn from their evil ways and ask God for mercy. God saw that they turned from their evil ways and he decided to show them mercy.\n  Chapt. 4: But Jonah was upset that God showed them mercy. Jonah sat down overlooking the city. God made a plant grow over his head to give him shade from the sun and Jonah was glad. But later, God sent a wind to dry up the plant. Jonah was upset and wanted to die. God showed him that it wasn’t right that Jonah felt bad about the plant and didn’t feel bad for the people of Nineveh who didn’t understand right from wrong.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is merciful\n- God is Lord of all people\n- God sees the heart\n- He is Creator of heaven, earth and the sea\n- God punishes sin\n- God warns people about His wrath\n- God loves to forgive sin\n- God is gracious\nApplication: |\n  God was merciful to the Ninevites and to Jonah. I can’t run away from God like Jonah wanted to. It’s dangerous to be disobedient to God. God forgives me and saves me when I call out to Him. I know that Jesus wants to save all people, even people who seem to be my enemies. God wants people to turn to Jesus.  Jonah wasn’t glad, but I can be glad about God’s plan to save people. Maybe God wants me to tell my enemies about salvation in Jesus.  Jesus, help me to remember that I don’t deserve your kindness, no one does, but that’s why the gospel is such good news!

He wanted to visit the believers in Rome so that they could encourage one another. (1:12) He wanted to preach Christ in Rome and wrote, “ For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ,  for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek. 17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.” (1:16-17) All people know that God exists (1:19-20). All people are sinners and need salvation. No one should judge another because we have all sinned against God and should know that, “the goodness of God leads you to repentance” (2:4) Both Jews and Gentiles need Jesus and His righteousness, “There is none righteous, no, not one;” (3:10) “But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, 22 even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (3:21-24)\n  God is the Savior of both the Jews and the Gentiles. “For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness” (4:3) God imputed righteousness to him by faith. This was before the Law and even before the rite of circumcision. “Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him, 24 but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, 25 who was delivered up because of our offenses, and was raised because of our justification.” (4:23-25)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Savior of all peoples\n- He is the Righteous One\n- He imputes His righteousness to believers\n- God is Holy\n- God is Creator\n- God is eternal\n- God is knowable\n- God is glorious\n- Jesus saves by grace\nApplication: |\n  I know that I am a sinner and I need Jesus’ forgiveness. All people groups in all times, throughout the whole world need Jesus’ salvation. Sometimes people say, “Jesus is only the God of that people group, but not for ours.” They think that their traditions or laws will save them. Just as the Law couldn’t save the Jewish people, so then any other religion cannot save people. Jesus is the only Savior.\n  I am imperfect and no one is perfect. Only Jesus, who is both God and man is perfect. He alone died and rose again and paid for my sin. He alone is righteous and can justify me and others. Abraham believed in God and it was accounted to him as righteousness. I also am justified before God through faith in Jesus. I want to trust Jesus and wait to tell people about salvation in Him. I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes! __Jesus, help me to share with people that You justify all who trust in You.

He followed God and God also gave him success and victory over his enemies. But later, he became proud and decided to go into the temple and do what only the priests were suppose to do. God punished him with a sickness.\n  2 Chron. 27: After Azariah, his son Joram reigned. He loved God and did what was right in the eyes of God. God blessed him.\n  2 Kings ch. 15: When King Azariah (also called Uzziah) reigned in Judah. In Israel, there were many different king who did what was evil in God’s sight. According to God’s Word spoken through the prophets, He sent the Assyrian king to fight against Israel, conquer them, take their cities and lead them away captive. “In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee—all the land of Naphtali—and deported the people to Assyria” (15:29). At this time, Uzziah’s son, Jotham reigned in Judah.\n  2 Kings 16: King Ahaz reigned after his father, Jotham. Syria and Israel attacked Jerusalem but didn’t conquer it. Ahaz paid the king of Assyria (Tiglath-pileser) to fight against Syria and he did. Ahaz had a new altar built and offered sacrifices on it.\n  Ch. 28: Ahaz didn’t love God and did evil in God’s sight. Ahaz decided to close up God’s temple and put idols throughout Jerusalem. This made God angry. “At the time of his distress, King Ahaz himself became more unfaithful to the Lord” (v.22).\n  2 Kings 17: Hosea reigned in Israel. They paid money to Assyria but then rebelled. “Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria. He deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, Gozan’s river, and in the cities of the Medes” (v. 5-6). The were exiled because they had sinned against the Lord, worshipped idols and did not listen to God’s Word through the prophets. “Even Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced“ (v. 19).\n  The Assyrian king relocated other nations to the land of Israel (17:24). God sent lions that attacked people. This caused them to ask a priest to teach them how to fear the Lord (v. 28). These different nations worshiped their false gods along with the Lord God in the land of Israel.\n  Isaiah 1-6: Isaiah was in the southern kingdom of Judah. God told His people that they were spiritually unhealthy, and that He wanted to heal and forgive their sin. He warned them that He would punish them to show them that their godless ways were dangerous and led to death. In Chapter 6, Isaiah sees a vision of God’s throne. God cleanses his sin and calls Isaiah to be His prophet.\n  Is. ch 7-14: Isaiah prophesied these words at the time of king Ahaz in Judah. God warned him of the coming wrath and also prophesied about the Messiah. God offered to give Ahaz a sign, but Ahaz didn’t want to ask of God. “Therefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel” (7:14).\n  Micah: Micah spoke God’s word to Samaria (the capitol of the northern kingdom, Israel) and to Jerusalem (the capitol of the southern kingdom, Judah). God through Micah said that He would judge them (see 3:1-2, 11-12). But God also spoke words of comfort and hope. He said that a Savior would come (5:2). God told the people, “Mankind, He has told you what is good and what it is the Lord requires of you: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God.” (6:8). Micah was a good example of following God. He said “But I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.” (7:7)\n\nCharacter:\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- God is holy\n- He is pure\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He punishes evil\n- He is ready to forgive and cleanse\n- Jesus is Immanuel, God with us\nApplication: |\n  God wants me to worship Him alone. He wants to have the first place in my life. It’s dangerous when I love to live my own way. When I ask Jesus to help me, He gives me strength to live right and to love God and others. God’s discipline shows me that if I don’t love Jesus, things will be hard and painful for me. Jesus can give me a heart that loves God and others. Idols are anything that we love more than God. Only Jesus is worthy of our worship. Worship is when we really love and value something or someone and do everything to please them. Worship is when we consider something to be most important to us. My desires can be idols if I consider them to be more important that Jesus and His will for me.\n  God sent His prophets to speak the Truth to His people at a time when they weren’t reading the Word or hearing the truth. He was faithful to make sure they knew who He was and what He was doing. Even when He punished their sin, He gave them words of comfort and promises of the Savior, Jesus.  In Isaiah 7:14,  it says that Jesus is Emmanuel which means “God with us.” I know that Jesus is the only Savior and that He is with me always. I want to worship Him alone.__Thank you God for your faithfulness and love towards me. Help me to love you above all and worship You alone.__\n\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people.

Our suffering for the sake of our faith changes us and gives us hope. God by the Holy Spirit gives us love in our hearts. (5:5) People usually are not willing to die for others, “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (5:8) Through Adam, sin came into the world and into human nature. Through faith in Jesus there is forgiveness of sins (a gift of grace) and reconciliation with God. Sin leads to death. Jesus’ grace gives life. “ For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.” (5:19)\n  Faith in Jesus changes how we live. “Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (6:8-11) We are no longer slaves of sin because Jesus freed us. “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (6:23)\n  “… the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.” (7:12) The Law shows us that we sin and it cannot save us, but condemns us when we don’t fulfill it. Sin within me wants to act against the law. Jesus rescues me from this body of death.\n  “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. ” (8:1-4) “But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.” (8:11) We don’t live for ourselves but now live by the Spirit. By the Spirit, we can call God, Father. We suffer now, but we have the hope of glory, that we will be with Jesus later. “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.” (8:18)\n  We wait with patience. The Holy Spirit, who lives within us helps us in our weakness. “ And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” (8:28) “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?” (8:31) We experience difficulties now but we will be with Jesus in His glory. We can be sure that, “For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (8:38-39)\nCharacter:\n- The Holy Spirit lives in believers in Jesus\n- Jesus gives life\n- There is hope in Jesus\n- Jesus frees from sin and death\n- Jesus died and rose again\n- Jesus justifies by His grace and mercy\n- God gives the gift of eternal life to believers\nApplication: |\n  My faith in Jesus changes me. Before I believed in Jesus, I was a slave to sin and I had no power to do what is right. But now, through faith in Jesus, I can live with Him. That is, His Holy Spirit lives in me and gives me new desires (to love God and others), and new life. The Life of Jesus in in me.\n  Sin controlled me before. Even if I didn’t really want to sin, I didn’t have strength to resist sin. But now, Jesus is My Lord and His Holy Spirit lives in me. I want to live for Jesus. I can ask Him for help and He will give me strength to act according to the Spirit. The Holy Spirit frees me from sin and death through faith in Jesus. In Jesus, I have a new nature, a new direction and a new destination!\n  All people without Jesus are dead in their sins. We all inherited the sinful nature of Adam. But believers in Jesus are given new life. He makes believers alive. Through faith in Jesus, by His grace and mercy, He gives us forgiveness, justification (that is, we are made right according to God’s Law), and the hope of glory. I know that despite the difficulties in this life, Jesus promised to receive me into glory. Nothing can separate me from His love. Jesus is always with me and His promises are firm and faithful. __Jesus, help me to reckon myself dead to sin and alive for God in Jesus Christ, my Lord.__\n\n  *Teacher!

Nahum: The expectation\n  of retribution on the surrounding nations. Isaiah: The expectation of international\n  salvation through Christ.'\nScripture: Hosea, Nahum, Isaiah 54\nTruth: God wants the rebellious to return to Him\nVerse: Nahum 1:7 “The Lord is good, a stronghold in a day of distress; He cares for\n  those who take refuge in Him.” of Hosea 2:19-20 “I will take you to be My wife forever.\n  I will take you to be My wife in righteousness, justice, love, and compassion. 20\n  I will take you to be My wife in faithfulness, and you will know Yahweh.”\nSummary: |+\n  Hosea: God wanted to show Israel that they were acting like an unfaithful wife. He used Hosea’s life to explain this. He told Hosea to marry Gomer, who was a prostitute (she sold her body in sin to other people). She had children and later left Hosea. But Hosea sought Gomer. She had become a slave and Hosea redeemed her. He was a faithful husband to her.\n  Hos. 3:5 “Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.”\n  Hos. 6:1-3 “Come, let us return to the Lord. For He has torn us, and He will heal us; He has wounded us, and He will bind up our wounds. 2 He will revive us after two days, and on the third day He will raise us up so we can live in His presence. 3 Let us strive to know the Lord. His appearance is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land.”\n  Isaiah 54: God said that He is like a husband to His people. His people acted like an unfaithful wife but God showed them his mercy and love. He disciplined the people and sent them into captivity to a different land but promised to return them to their land. “Though the mountains move and the hills shake, My love will not be removed from you and My covenant of peace will not be shaken,” says your compassionate Lord” (54:10).\n\n  Nahum: The prophet Nahum lived during the reign of king Josiah in Judah (the southern kingdom). The Assyrians had already led the northern kingdom of Israel away into captivity. God said that he would punish Nineveh, the capitol of the Assyrian empire for their cruel treatment of God’s people. God said that He would judge the sinful city. Nahum prophesied that water and fire would destroy the city: 2:6 “The river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away” (2:6). “Nineveh has been like a pool of water from her first days, but they are fleeing. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back” (2:8). “The fire will devour you there…” (3:15). “…the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour the bars of your gates” (3:13)\n  God also wanted to comfort the people who suffered at the hands of the Assyrians. He said:\n  1:15 “Look to the mountains— the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out” (1:15).  “For the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes, the majesty of Israel…” (2:2).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is a jealous God\n- He is Holy\n- God is Redeemer\n- God is Holy\n- God is merciful\n- God is faithful and unchanging\n- He is compassionate\n- He is a husband to His people\n- He is good\n- He cares for those to take refuge in HIm.God punishes sin\n- God is Comforter\n- God sees everything\n- God knows everything\n- God guides everything\n- God is the author of history\n- He fulfills His Word\n- God has a good plan\n- God is a righteous judge\nApplication: |\n  God loves me very much. He is always with me and promises to be with me forever. When I sin and love something or someone more than God, I am cheating on God (being unfaithful to Him).Hosea’s life and his attitude towards Gomer showed people that God is faithful to Israel even though they worshiped idols and didn’t love God. They became slaves to sin but God redeemed them. I can ask Jesus to forgive me and He helps me to love Him more than anyone or anything. When I live my own way, I become a slave to sin. Jesus came to earth and lived a sinless life, died on the cross and on the 3rd day rose again. He paid for my sin with His blood and frees me from the power of sin when I trust Him. He is my Redeemer, (like the example of Hosea and his wife Gomer). Jesus is faithful and I belong to Him. Jesus, help me to love you and follow after you all of my days. I love you.\n  In the book of Nahum, God comforts Israel at a time when Assyria was cruel to them. Israel was suffering for the consequences of their sin, but God still wanted to express His love towards them. He gave them hope in HIm during a difficult time. Maybe I have done something wrong and am suffering the consequences for my sin. God still loves me and even His discipline shows me that He loves me. He wants me to draw close to Him and to trust Him. He is my help and He cares for me when I take refuge in HIm.\n  Earlier, God spoke to the city of Nineveh through the prophet Jonah. At that time, Nineveh repented and God saved them from judgement. But in time, they again started to do evil and God later punished them. God fulfilled His Word in Nahum when the Babylonian Empire came,  captured Nineveh and destroyed the city with water and fire. I can know that God keeps and fulfills His Word. Everything that I read in the Bible is true. I can trust the Bible. Also, I should take the Bible seriously. God hates sin. I also should hate sin and ask Jesus for help to stop doing what is not pleasing to God. Jesus knows those who trust in Him (Nahum 1:7). When people sin against me, He helps me and comforts me. He gives me strength to love my enemies and gives me  hope, knowing that my suffering is temporary. I have a good future when I trust Jesus. He will avenge the evil people in the end because He is the Righteous Judge.\n\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, “…you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one’s own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, “All the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.” Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.\n"}</script>

Many of them tried to find God through works, through the keeping of the Law, and not by faith. (9:2) God shows mercy to whom He wants. He showed the Gentiles mercy when Jesus died for all and not only for the Jews.\n  Righteousness is given through Jesus and not through the Law, “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.” (10:4) “that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. ” (10:9-10) “ For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved”How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!” (10:13-15) “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (10:17)\n  God has a good plan for the Jews. Through them He gave God’s Word and sent Jesus. Now, the Gentiles through faith can become a part of  God’s “family tree”. Gentiles should be thankful that God allowed them to be a part of His family. Now, few Jews believe in Jesus because it is the time for the Gentiles but, “…all Israel will be saved… For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable”  and later many Jews will believe.(11:26, 29)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God’s righteousness for believers\n- Jesus fulfilled the Law\n- Jesus is Savior for the Jews and Gentiles\n- God has mercy upon whom He wants\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is my righteousness. I have no righteousness of my own. I can’t do enough good deeds or keep the law in my own strength in order to be right before God.  I am saved only through faith in Jesus. Jesus is the only Savior for all people. There is no other Savior and no other way. I am thankful that Jesus died for me and not only for Jews.__ Jesus, I want people to know You as Savior and Lord.

During his reign, Assyria took the northern kingdom (Israel) into captivity because of their disobedience. Hezekiah also feared the threat of the king of Assyria and prayed to God. God told him through the prophet Isaiah that He would save them from the enemy. God send an angel who killed many soldiers in the enemy’s army and they left. Hezekiah later got sick and God said that he would die. But when Hezekiah prayed to God, He decided to give him another 15 years to live. When people from Babylon came to visit Hezekiah, he proudly showed them all of his treasures. God told Hezekiah through Isaiah that later, the Babylonians would take all his treasures for themselves. Hezekiah didn’t take God’s words seriously. After a few more generations, God sent Babylon to take the southern kingdom away to captivity.\n  2 Chron Ch. 29-32: Hezekiah helped people to turn back to God and start worshiping God rightly. 30:20, 26 and 31:20-21.\n  “Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the Lord’s temple in Jerusalem to observe the Passover of Yahweh, the God of Israel.” (2 Chron.30:1). “So the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the hand of the king and his officials, and according to the king’s command, saying, “Israelites, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped from the grasp of the kings of Assyria. 7 Don’t be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors so that He made them an object of horror as you yourselves see. 8 Don’t become obstinate now like your fathers did. Give your allegiance to Yahweh, and come to His sanctuary that He has consecrated forever. Serve the Lord your God so that He may turn His burning anger away from you, 9 for when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.” 10 The couriers traveled from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but the inhabitants laughed at them and mocked them. 11 But some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 12 Also, the power of God was at work in Judah to unite them  to carry out the command of the king and his officials by the word of the Lord.” (2 Chron. 30:6-12).\n  1 Chron.32:25 because of pride, wrath was upon the southern kingdom. God tested the heart of the king (32:31).\n  According to Jer. 26:18, Micah spoke these words against the corrupt leaders during Hezekiah’s reign: “Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the hill of the temple mount will be a thicket. “ (3:12).\n  Isaiah 15-39: God gave Isaiah these worlds when Hezekiah was king. He spoke of the judgement of the nations that didn’t believe in God. He warned people to not trust Assyria. He said that the great Babylonian empire would one day fall.\n  Ch. 24: a description the end of the world and God’s wrath upon the earth.\n  Ch. 25: Those who trust God will live on a new earth\n  Ch. 26: There is hope for those who trust in God. (v. 19 speaks of resurrection).\n  Ch. 27-29: God punished the disobedient people. God warns them to not trust Egypt, who can’t save them. (ch. 30-31)\n  Only God can help.\n  Ch. 32-38: God calls people to trust Him and not their own strength. God blesses those who trust Him and punishes those who don’t.\n  Ch. 36-39: a repetition of the story found in 2 Chron 29-32\n\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign\n- God is our protection\n- God is our help\n- He is Mighty\n- He hears our prayers\n- He knows all hearts\n- He is Holy\nApplication: |\n  When I look at the life of Hezekiah, I see that it’s important to trust God and remember that He is the most important. When Hezekiah was humble before God, everything was ok in his kingdom. Even when enemies came, God miraculously saved them. When I seek God (read his Word, pray to Him and desire His help daily) He blesses me with peace and joy in my heart even if my circumstances aren’t peaceful around me. I know that He is with me and that He hears my prayers.\n  Hezekiah was proud of his riches and boasted before people. He didn’t understand that every blessing comes from God. When I am successful, I should remember that success comes from God and I should thank Him. God, help me to always trust You and not trust in my own strength or wisdom. Also, help me to be obedient to Your Word and listen to those who want to warn me if I start to walk away from You. Give me a humble heart. A humble heart is a happy heart. __Jesus, help me to be thankful for all that You give  and have a humble heart before You and others always.__\n"}</script>

They love people and use the gifts of the Holy Spirit. God wants us to love even our enemies. “Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” (12:21)\n  Believers respect the government. “Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law” (13:8) Believers live pleasing to God. they don’t live according to the desires of the flesh. “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.” (13:14)\n  We don’t judge one another when there are different opinions about what is alright to eat or which day of the week is more important.

Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God.” (15:5-7) God sent Jesus to the Jews according to His promise and Scripture says a lot about God’s plan to save the Gentiles. Paul wanted to preach about Jesus in places where people hadn’t heard about Him yet. He quoted the prophet Isaiah, “To whom He was not announced, they shall see; And those who have not heard shall understand” (15:21) Paul wanted to go to Rome.\n  Paul sent a greeting to believers that he knew in Rome. He warned them not to listen to people who wanted to divide them and teach what was wrong. He wanted them to be wise in what is good and innocent about what is evil.

My life and all that I do and desire and strive for is submitted to Jesus. I am, “a living sacrifice” and worship Him with my life. How can I live for Jesus? In chapter 12 there are a lot of practical examples and advice. I want to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit to love believers.

All who wait patiently for Him\n  are happy.” or Is. 42:8 “I am Yahweh, that is My name; I will not give My glory\n  to another or My praise to idols.”\nSummary: |+\n  Ch.40: God comforts His people and promises to be their shepherd. Verse 8, “The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.” God is the Living God and is not like idols, which are made my people’s hands. v. 29-31 “He gives strength to the weary and strengthens the powerless. 30 Youths may faint and grow weary, and young men stumble and fall, 31 but those who trust in the Lord will renew their strength; they will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary; they will walk and not faint.”\n  Ch. 41: In verses 10 and 13, God says that He helps His people and that they shouldn’t be afraid.

He is the only One who can free me from sin. Israel went into captivity because of their sin. They didn’t love God, didn’t listen to His Word and worshipped idols. God alone is worthy of worship. He is worthy of obedience and He hates idol worship*. God punished His people sending them to Babylon for a time. My sin separates me from God when I don’t listen to His Word. I am not loving God when I live my own way. But God promised to return Israel to the land and told them many years ahead of time so that they would know that it was God who freed them. I can draw near to God through faith in Jesus, knowing that He paid for my sin. There will be a day when God will punish all those who don’t believe in Jesus. He will pour out His wrath on the earth but those who trust in Jesus will be with Him forever, where everything is wonderful. I want to trust Jesus now. I want to tell people about Jesus, so that they won’t have to experience God’s wrath. I can tell people that Jesus is the only Savior. __God help me to trust you, follow You and tell people about salvation in Jesus.__\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God’s Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people.

In the morning, Paul and his friends went on to Miletus where he called the leaders of the Ephesian church to come to him. He shared with them, that the Holy Spirit was telling him that he would suffer for the gospel in Jerusalem. Paul said, “But I count my life of no value to myself, so that I may finish my course  and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God’s grace.” (20:24) He warned them of false teachers and said, “And now I commit you to God and to the message of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.” (20:32)\n  On the way to Jerusalem, they stopped in Tyre where the believers there, by the Holy Spirit, told Paul not to go to Jerusalem. (21:4) In Caesarea, the prophet Agabus said that Paul would be arrested in Jerusalem. But Paul was ready to go to prison and even ready to die for the name of the Lord Jesus. (21:13). When Paul went to the temple in Jerusalem, the Jews grabbed him and the whole city was stirred up. They said that Paul taught people wrong and started to beat him. A Roman soldier came and took Paul out of the crowd as they were yelling, “take him away!” Paul asked to speak to the crowd.\n  Paul told them how he came to believe in Jesus. When he told them that Jesus sent him to preach to the Gentiles, the crowd started yelling again. The soldier called for the Jews to meet in order to find out why they were accusing Paul.\n  At the meeting, the Pharisees and Sadducees couldn’t agree about Paul and started to argue. The Roman soldier took Paul to the barracks, “The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, “Have courage! For as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.” (23:11) The Jews wanted to kill Paul, but the Roman soldier sent Paul away by night to the governor in Caesarea. There, he awaited a court hearing.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- He is always with His own\n- The Holy Spirit speaks\n- God sends believers out to share the gospel\n- God encourages and comforts His own\n- The Holy Spirit warns and prepares believers\nApplication: |\n  Paul experienced much joy as well as sorrow for the sake of his faith in Jesus. Jesus was always with him. He knew many people in different countries from different cultures. He loved them and they loved him. Jesus unified believers from different cultures. I am thankful to God for the family of God in Jesus Christ.\n  Perhaps people will accuse me of doing something evil because I am a believer in Jesus. Paul was in prison but God spoke to him and was always with him. God told him to “take courage” and that he would testify of Jesus in Rome. __Jesus, give me boldness and strength to continue to trust You when it’s hard and to witness about You. Thank you that You are always with me. Help me to be a witness for You all the time and everywhere (at home, in school, with my family etc). Fill me with the Holy Spirit and speak to me so that people would know that You are the Savior of all.__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

Paul shared his faith in Jesus Christ, “Now as he spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and replied, “Leave for now, but when I find time I’ll call for you.” (24:25) He wanted to receive a bribe and Paul sat in prison for 2 years. Later, a new governor took over and Felix left Paul in prison to make the Jews happy.\n  The new governor, Festus held another court hearing with the Jews and Paul. He wanted to make the Jews happy and send Paul to Jerusalem, but Paul wanted to stand in court before Caesar. King Agrippa was visiting Festus and Paul shared with him about Jesus. Festus said that Paul wasn’t guilty.

Zephaniah: The Retribution on Judah and the nations.'\nScripture: 2 Kings 21-23:1-30, 2 Chron 33-35, Zephaniah, Jer. 1-6, 8-19\nTruth: God hates evil\nVerse: Zeph. 3:17 “Yahweh your God is among you, a warrior who saves. He will rejoice\n  over you with gladness. He will bring you quietness with His love. He will delight\n  in you with shouts of joy.”\nSummary: |+\n  Ch. 21: Manasseh reigned in Jerusalem (in the southern kingdom) and did evil in the sight of God. He worshiped idols and led the people into idol worship. God sent his prophets to say that He would punish them for their disobedience. 2 Chron 33:10-13 records that God led Manasseh away to Assyria. There he repented and God returned him to Jerusalem. Then he knew that the Lord is God. Manasseh died and his son, Amon, became king. He abandoned the Lord and people killed him. Then his son Josiah became king when he was only 8 years old.\n  Ch. 22: Josiah wanted to fix the temple. The high priest, Hilkiah helped him. They found the book of the Law (Scripture) in the temple and read it to the king. The king tore his clothing when he realized that his people had been disobedient to God’s Word and that they deserved punishment. He wanted to know what God thought about it all and asked a prophet to find out God’s will. The prophetess Huldah said that God would punish them after Josiah’s reign because he humbled himself before God. (also recorded in 2 Chron 34)\n  Ch. 23: Josiah gathered people to Jerusalem and taught them God’s Word. He and the people promised to follow God. Hilkiah the priest cleansed the temple and destroyed all the idols. The king commanded that the whole land be cleansed of idols, places of idol worship and of idolatrous priests. Josiah turned to God with his whole heart. The people celebrated Passover. They hadn’t celebrated since the time when Samuel was alive (2 Chron. 35:1-19). Later, the king died in war against the king of Egypt (see 2 Chron 35:21 where he was warned).\n\n  Zephaniah: Zephaniah spoke God’s Word during the days of king Josiah. God said that He would punish Jerusalem because people weren’t seeking Him and were walking away from Him (1:6). God calls people to seek Him, to humble themselves before Him and to do righteousness in order to find God’s mercy (2:3). God also punishes Assyria for their evil.\n  The people didn’t listen to God (3:2) but God is righteous (3:5). God promises a glorious future where God Himself will reign as King among them (3:15-17).\n\n  Jeremiah: God spoke His Word through Jeremiah, who was a priest during the time of Josiah, king of Judah. God told Jeremiah, “I chose you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart before you were born. I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”  Jeremiah wrote, “Then the Lord reached out His hand, touched my mouth, and told me: I have now filled your mouth with My words. 10 See, I have appointed you today over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and demolish, to build and plant” (1:9-10). God promised to help Jeremiah when people would be against him. “They will fight against you but never prevail over you, since I am with you to rescue you.” (1:19).\n\n\n  see also Is. 64:8 “Yet Lord, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are our potter; we all are the work of Your hands”\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Righteous\n- God is King\n- God is Holy\n- God punishes sin\n- God is merciful\n- God promises a glorious future to believers\n- God is longsuffering (very patient)\n- Jesus is King.God is Lord of all\n- He sees everything\n- He is Sovereign and has all authority\n- He is worthy of worship and obedience\n- God is a Defence and Help\n- God fulfills His Word (Jer.1:12)\n- God is Redeemer (Jer.1:19)\n- He is Wise, Kind and Loving\nApplication: |\n  The Bible reveals God’s heart to me. In it, I can see what is pleasing to God and what is not. The people in Judah lost God’s Word and stopped loving God. They stopped listening to the warnings of His prophets (who shared God’s Word with them). But with Jesus’ help, I can read the Bible and listen to God! When I read it every day and seek God, He can teach me and change me.\n  The people in Judah couldn’t follow God themselves and keep His law. They needed help from God. I also can’t live right in my own strength. Jesus helps me and gives me the Holy Spirit who lives in me and gives me strength and the desire to love God and others. The people celebrated Passover. I know that Passover speaks of Jesus. They remembered the time when God brought them out of slavery in Egypt and the blood of the lamb covered their homes. I know that the blood of Jesus paid for my sin and when i trust Jesus, He frees me from slavery to sin.\n  Zephaniah said that God will punish non-believers. But He also promises that there will be a time when Israel will a blessed land for everyone and Jesus will reign there in Israel. I know that it’s important to tell people about the salvation that Jesus gives so that God’s wrath wouldn’t be upon them. I know that Jesus will return and I want to trust Him every day and tell people about Him while I wait for Him. He is King of kings and Lord of lords.\n  God called Jeremiah to be His prophet and tell people His Words. Jesus calls me to be God’s child and share the good news of salvation with people. Jeremiah was young, but God promised to be with him and to help him. Jesus also calls the young, the old and everyone to follow Him. He promises to help us and even to give us the Holy Spirit who helps us every minute to love God and others. God showed Jeremiah that He has all authority and can do what He wants, just as the potter can with his clay. And so my life also belongs to Jesus and I can trust Him in all that He wants to do with my life. I can rejoice in God’s word in my life, knowing that He is wise, kind and loving. The people in Jeremiah’s time didn’t want to listen to God’s Word and made fun of Jeremiah. I don’t want to be like those who didn’t listen to God’s Word. Also, I should remember that sometimes people don’t receive God’s Word. Maybe they will even make fun of me. But God is with me and He is my help and defence. God punishes those that don’t believe in Jesus. That’s why I want to tell people that Jesus wants to forgive their sin. __Jesus, help me to share lovingly with people about salvation in You. Please save people, so that they won’t perish.__\n"}</script>

What can man do to me?”)'\nSummary: |\n  Paul went to Jerusalem and was arrested there for his faith in Jesus. God gave him an opportunity to share about salvation in Jesus with many kinds and leaders during the time when he was imprisoned and waited for the decision about his case in court. Paul was a Roman citizen and had a right to speak with the Roman king (Caesar) about his case. The governor allowed this and sent him to Caesar. (Acts 25:12)\n  Paul (a prisoner for his faith in Jesus) sailed on the ship with other prisoners. Some of Paul’s friends sailed with him. Paul knew that the weather was bad for traveling but the captain decided to sail. They ended up in a storm that lasted for 2 weeks! God sent His angel to Paul who said, “Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you” (27:24). Paul believed God’s word and encouraged everyone. There was a shipwreck and all 276 people made it to shore on the island of Malta. The Maltese helped them to build a fire. When Paul was helping, a snake bit him and hung on his arm! All the locals thought that this was punishment from God but Paul didn’t get sick from the snake bite. God healed people on the island through Paul.\n  Then they traveled on to Rome. There Paul lived in a house with soldiers while he waited for his court case. He gathered with the Jews and told them about Jesus. Some believed and some didn’t. Paul said that God wants to save the Gentiles too. “Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.” (28:30-31).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Saviour of all\n- Jesus always is with His own\n- God fulfills His plan\n- God protects\n- Jesus never leaves or forsakes His own\n- Jesus heals.God fulfills His Word\n- Jesus is the main theme of the Scriptures (in the Law, the Prophets and through\n  the whole Bible)\nApplication: |\n  Paul became a prisoner for his faith in Jesus. He saw that God had a plan for him. He didn’t stop talking to people about Jesus even when he was a prisoner. I know that God has a good plan for my life which He wants to fulfill. Wherever I am, I can be sure that Jesus is with me, that He is my help and that nothing can stop God from fulfilling His plan. __Jesus, help me to tell people about Your love and about how You want to forgive their sins and give them new life in You.__\n  Sometimes Paul was in scary situations but Jesus always was with him and helped him to boldly share about Him. Jesus, help me to not be afraid but to trust You and always boldly tell people that You are Saviour. When Paul shared, some people believed in Jesus and some didn’t. When I share about Jesus, some people will believe in Him and some will not. I must simply tell the truth and pray that God would save them. I want to pray for the salvation of ______________ (name).\n  God wants to save everyone from every people group. Paul was Jewish and when he traveled, he began by telling the Jews about Jesus. But he also shared with the Gentiles and many of them believed in Jesus. Maybe it’s easy for me to tell people of my our nationality about Jesus, and maybe it’s hard. Jesus will lead me and show me who to share with and how.\n  __Jesus, I know that You want everyone to know You. In heaven, people from all different nations, tribes and languages will praise You! Thank you that you are always with me. Lead me and use my life so that many people and many nations would love You and worship You! You are worthy!__\n\n  *Teacher!

Then, “Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God.” (v. 5).\n\n  2 Kings 23:31-37-ch.24:1-7: Jehoiakim paid tribute to Pharaoh Neco of Egypt. Then he served Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon for 3 years. When he rebelled against him, many different nations attacked Judah (the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites) according to God’s word through the prophets (v. 24:2). “Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon” (2 Chron. 36:6).\n\n  Jeremiah: Jeremiah continued to speak God’s Word to the people, that God would destroy Jerusalem because of their disobedience. He also said that their punishment would only be for 70 years (25:11-12). The priests and false prophets wanted to kill Jeremiah for speaking against them, but the leaders wouldn’t allow it (ch. 26). God used the obedience of the Rechabites to show Judah their disobedience (ch. 35).\n  Ch. 36: During the reign of king Jehoiakim, God gave Jeremiah His word, which Jeremiah wrote on a scroll. God gave the people an opportunity to repent, “Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.” The people didn’t want to hear the truth and turn to God. The king listened to parts of God’s Word on the scroll and bit by bit cut them off and threw them into the fire (v.23). Jeremiah dictated the words from the scroll that had been burned to his servant (v. 32). God said that none of king Jehoiakim’s sons would sit on David’s throne (v. 30-31).\n  Ch. 45-48: God said that he would use Babylon to judge Egypt. He would also judge the Philistines and Moabites. The Ammonites would also be judged but God promised to restore them afterwards (49:1- 6).\n\n  Habakkuk: The prophet asked God why unrighteousness was allowed to continue in Judah. God answered that He planned to punish Judah using Babylon. Then the prophet asked why God would punish them using a nation that was more evil than Judah. God said that He would later punish Babylon. Habakkuk hoped in God and knew that God would save those who trusted Him.  He wrote, “…the righteous one will live by his faith” (2:4). “Though the fig tree does not bud and there is no fruit on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, 18 yet I will triumph in Yahweh; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation! 19 Yahweh my Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like those of a deer and enables me to walk on mountain heights!” (3:17-19).\nCharacter:\n- God is the Righteous Judge\n- God’s Word is eternal\n- God fulfills His Word\n- God warns, calls to repentance, punishes, restores\n- Jesus is our Righteousness\n- He gives life\n- God’s Word is Eternal and cannot be destroyed\n- He is our salvation\n- He is our strength\nApplication: |\n  Jeremiah spoke God’s Word to the people in Judah, even though they didn’t receive it. The king rejected God’s Word and even burned the scroll, but Jeremiah had it re-written. This shows me that God’s Word cannot be destroyed. People may burn the pages where it is written, but His Word will endure forever. Is. 40:8 says “The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.” Since this is true, I should treasure God’s Word, read it, study it, memorize it, live by it and most importantly: believe it! Reading the Word, I see how many times the Lord spoke something and then fulfilled His Word. I see that He is faithful and righteous in all that He does.\n  King Jehoiakim and the people suffered because they rejected God’s Word. The Bible is filled with examples of people who believed God’s Word and those who didn’t. Those who believed God’s Word had faith in Him. Habakkuk said that the righteous will live by faith (Hab. 2:4). This verse is quoted often in the Bible (Rom. 1:16-17, Gal. 3:11, Heb. 10:38). This verse can be understood by remembering Gen 15:6, where it says, “Abram believed the Lord, and He credited it to him as righteousness.” When I believe God and His Word, He gives me His righteousness. Jesus is my righteousness. He fulfilled all the law and took my punishment for sin upon Himself. He now gives me His strength to love God and others with my life. 2 Cor. 5:7 says that “we walk by faith and not by sight.” Habakkuk reminds me that I can rejoice in God even when circumstances are terrible because I believe that He is the God of my salvation, my strength and the One who helps me to walk daily with Jesus. __Jesus, please help me to know, believe and walk in Your Word. Help me to love You and believe You, no matter what is happening around me. You are faithful and Your Word is eternal. Thank you that You are my righteousness.__\n"}</script>

Christ dwells in believers and this is the hope of glory.\n  “Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, 7 rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with gratitude.” (2:6-7) Paul warned believers to believe the truth and to not believe as the world does. “ And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive with Him and forgave us all our trespasses. 14 He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross. 15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; He triumphed over them by Him” (2:13-15)\n  “So if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. 3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God.” (3:1-3) When believers know Jesus more, He transforms them into His image (3:10). Believers belong to Jesus and this is why they walk in love, forgiving one another and doing all in the name of the Lord Jesus with thanksgiving (3:12-17). Believers should love one another in all different relationships (husbands, wives, children, bosses, workers).\n  Paul wrote, “Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving. 3 At the same time, pray also for us that God may open a door to us for the message, to speak the mystery of the Messiah, for which I am in prison” (Col. 4:2-3)\n\n  Philemon: Paul sent a letter to Philemon in Colosse. The church gathered in his home. Onesimus was Philemon’s slave and had ran away to Rome where he became a believer in Jesus. Paul wanted Philemon to receive Onesimus back as a brother in Christ (v. 16). Paul wanted them to reconcile and was ready to pay Philemon whatever Onesimus owed him (v. 18).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Creator\n- He is God\n- He is Savior and Victor\n- Jesus has a kingdom of Love and light\n- He is before all things and in Him all things hold together\n- He is Redeemer\n- Christ is in believers\n- God is the Lord of heaven\nApplication: |\n  I know that Jesus is God. He was with God the Father and the Holy Spirit when they created everything. He gave me the Holy Spirit and Jesus lives within me. His presence with me is the hope of glory. That is, I am certain that i will be with Him eternally in heaven (in glory) because right now He is with me. This is amazing news. I am very thankful to Jesus that He with with me now. I am in His kingdom and I will be with Him forever. He forgave my sin on the cross and He renews and changes me. I want to be more like Jesus. __Jesus, help me to walk in love, forgive others and abide in the Word. When I hear different ideas and philosophies from people, help me to remember what the Bible says about it so that I won’t be deceived.__\n   Jesus, Your forgiveness and love changes my relationships. You are pleased when I obey my parents (3:20). I sometimes don’t want to obey. Onesimus didn’t want to listen to his master, Philemon. But Jesus changed his life and could help him to reconcile with Philemon. __Jesus, change my life and give me love for You and those around me. Help me to forgive those who offend me. You forgave me and I want to forgive too! Teach me when I read the Word and give me a heart that is thankful to You for all that You have done, are doing and will do for me. Jesus, give me a desire and opportunity to share with people about You: the God who forgives the sins of those who trust in Him.__\n\n  *Teacher!

Jeremiah: The expectation of covenantal Reaffirmation in\n  Christ. Ezekiel: The expectation of the nation’s religious restoration by Christ.'\nScripture: 2 Kings 24:8-ch. 25:1-21, 2 Chron. 36:9-21, Jeremiah 20-24, 27-34, *37-39,\n  50-52, Ezekiel 1-10\nTruth: God promises a hope and a future\nVerse: Jer. 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“plans\n  for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.”\nSummary: |\n  2 Kings 24:8-17 and 2 Chron. 36:9-21: After Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin reigned for 3 months when “Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon along with the valuable utensils of the Lord’s temple. (2 Chron 36:10). Jehoiachin surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar and 10,000 people were led away to Babylon (2 Kings 24:10-14).\n  King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, king (2 Kings 24:17). “He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet at the Lord’s command” (2 Chron 36:12). The people didn’t want to listen to God’s Word from the prophets and return to God.“But Yahweh, the God of their ancestors sent word against them by the hand of His messengers, sending them time and time again, for He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. 16 But they kept ridiculing God’s messengers, despising His words, and scoffing at His prophets, until the Lord’s wrath was so stirred up against His people that there was no remedy” (2 Chron 36: 15-16).\n  Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. When Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem, Zedekiah tried to escape by night, but was caught and taken to Babylon. Then the king of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and the temple and took the people captive to Babylon along with all the treasures for 70 years, according to God’s Word (2 Kings 25:1-21,2 Chron 36:21).\n\n  Ezekiel 1-10: God spoke to Ezekiel after King Jehoiachin and the first group of people had been exiled to Babylon. He showed the prophet Ezekiel incredible visions which he spoke to the exiles. He saw heavenly creatures, the throne of God, the glory of God and heard God’s voice (ch. 1-2). God called Ezekiel to be a watchman for Israel and to faithfully speak His words of warning to them (3:16-21). Ezekiel was told to act out the siege and destruction of Jerusalem (ch. 4-5). He spoke of God’s judgement against idolatry (ch. 6-7). The Lord showed him that the people were doing bad things in God’s temple and that they would be punished. In a vision, Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord leave the temple in Jerusalem.\n\n  Jeremiah: These chapters of Jeremiah took place during the reigns of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah.\n  Ch. 20-24: Jeremiah warned people of God’s judgement upon them and called them to do justice and  righteousness (v.22:3). In Ch. 23 God speaks of the Righteous Branch who will reign as king. God says, “Is not My word like fire”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“and like a hammer that pulverizes rock?”(23:29). In ch. 24, God compares King Zedekiah to bad figs that need to be thrown out.\n  Ch. 27-28: Jeremiah was told by God to wear a yoke and show Zedekiah that Judah was going to be under the control of Babylon. Hananiah, a false prophet, broke the yoke off of Jeremiah and said that Judah would break away from Babylon’s control. Jeremiah said, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord did not send you, but you have led these people to trust in a lie” (28:15). The Lord told him that Hananiah would die and he did.\n  Ch. 29, Jeremiah wrote a letter to the exiles who were already in Babylon. God told them to settle there and not to listen to the false prophets. “ For this is what the Lord says: “When 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm My promise concerning you to restore you to this place. 11 For I know the plans I have for you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. 12 You will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. 14 I will be found by you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you”—this is the Lord’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place I deported you from.” (29:10-14). God said, “…I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.” (31:3). He promises to make a new covenant with His people, to write His law on their hearts, to forgive their iniquity and remember their sins no more (31:31-34).\n  Ch. 32-34: Jeremiah buys a field during the siege of Jerusalem and the Lord explains that it means that the people will return to the land after their time of exile. God says, “Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?“ (32:27) and “Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know” (33:3). In Ch. 34, God says that king Zedekiah will die in peace in Babylon.\n  *Ch.37-39: King Zedekiah asked Jeremiah to pray for the people. Jeremiah said that Babylon would take Jerusalem. The officials in Jerusalem beat Jeremiah and put him in prison because they didn’t believe him. The king sent for Jeremiah to hear a word from the Lord. Jeremiah told him that Zedekiah would be delivered into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. He asked to not be sent back to where he was being held (ch. 37). Then the king gave some men permission to throw Jeremiah into a cistern, where there was no water. He sank in the mud. Ebed-Melech talked to the king and rescued Jeremiah from the cistern and he remained under guard. King Zedekiah secretly met with Jeremiah. He told the king to surrender to Babylon so that the city wouldn’t be burned and his family wouldn’t be killed (ch. 38). However, when Babylon came against Jerusalem, Zedekiah fled, his family was killed and the city was burned. The Babylonians released Jeremiah from being under guard. God told Ebed-Melech that he would be saved because he trusted Him (39:15-18).\n  Ch. 50-52: God speaks judgement against Babylon. “Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Hosts is His name. He will fervently plead their case so that He might bring rest to the earth but turmoil to those who live in Babylon” (50:34).\n\n  2 Chron 36:22-23 records that after 70 years, King Cyrus of Persia fulfilled God’s Word spoken through Jeremiah and allowed the people to return to their land and rebuild the temple. (see Ezra 1:1-4 )\nCharacter:\n- God is Judge\n- He fulfills His Word\n- God is merciful\n- God is longsuffering (very patient)\n- God communicates His will and His truth\n- He is compassionate\n- He is righteous\n- God loves His people\n- God intends good things for His people\n- Jesus is the Righteous Branch\n- God is glorious\n- He is Redeemer\nApplication: |\n  The people of Judah didn’t want to listen to God’s Word and return to God. That’s why God punished them. But at the same time, God promised to show them mercy when they turned back to Him. Sometimes, I don’t love God and do things that are not pleasing to Him. He disciplines me so that I would know that my path is dangerous. He wants me to walk closely with Him.__ Jesus, help me to love You, believe Your Word, turn to You and live for You. __\n  Ezekiel and Jeremiah loved God and followed Him at a time that was difficult. People didn’t want to hear the truth and were rejecting God. But God was faithful to tell them the truth, warm them and share His promises of mercy with them. Jeremiah was beaten, put in prison and threatened with death. But God had promised to take care of Him and He did. It is painful to be rejected by people but we are accepted by God.  Jesus was rejected by people and suffered unjustly. He understands what it’s like to follow God the Father and be rejected by others. When things are hard, I can trust God that He is merciful towards me. I can ask Jesus for strength and help. He teaches me that His ways are better and gives me joy and peace in relationship with Jesus. __Jesus, help me to love, trust and obey You like the prophets did. Remind me of Your amazing promises, that I would rejoice in You, My Redeemer! Thank you for the hope and future that I have in You, Jesus.__\n"}</script>

(1:3)'\nScripture: Eph. 1-3\nTruth: Jesus saves by grace\nVerse: Eph 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of\n  yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast.”\nSummary: |\n  After Paul and a group of believers were in Philippi, they traveled to many cities and shared about Jesus. They were in Ephesus. The first time Paul was there for a short time but other believers stayed there (Acts 18:18-21). Then he went back and was with the believers there for 3 years (Acts 20:31).\n  Spiritual Blessings: In Jesus Christ, believers have every spiritual blessing in the heavens. In Jesus, God gives believers holiness, makes them His children, gives them forgiveness, gives them an inheritance in heaven and the Holy Spirit (1:1-14).\n  Saved by Grace: “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast” (Eph 2:8-9). Earlier, we were all under the influence of sin and were God’s enemies. But now, in Jesus each believer is a new creation of God that fulfills the plans that God has for them. (2:10).\n  Unity in Christ: Jesus makes Jewish and Gentile believers one in Himself. They aren’t divided anymore. (2:14-16) The Church (Jews and Gentiles together) show God’s wisdom to the spiritual world (3:10).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- Jesus makes all believers one\n- Jesus is the head of the Church\n- Jesus is our Protection\n- 'Jesus is: Salvation, Truth, the Good News, Righteousness'\n- Jesus gives believers a new heart and the Holy Spirit\nApplication: |\n  Jesus saved me and changes my life. I used to be far from God and was His enemy. Believers in Jesus believe: that He is God, that He never sinned, that He fulfilled God’s law, that He took my punishment in my place for my disobedience, that He died and rose again, that He forgave my sin and gave me the Holy Spirit and that He loves me. Do I believe in Jesus? When I believe in Him, I love Him. When I love Him, I love other people, especially believers. When I believe in Him, I ask Him and He gives me strength to love Him and others and to resist evil. He helps me.\n  Jesus saved me and others by grace alone. Grace is when God gives me His undeserved kindness, mercy and love. No one deserves anything good from God, but Jesus offers me and all people His grace. I never can do enough good in order to be accepted by God. Only Jesus could fulfill the whole Law, die for the sin of the world and rise again. Now through Jesus and only through Jesus all the spiritual riches belong to me in Christ Jesus! I want to share this good news with other people. I don’t want them to be children of wrath who aren’t friends with God. I want them to become children of God through faith in Jesus and the knowledge of His love and grace. Who can I tell about Jesus’ grace? __Jesus, help me to understand for myself and to share with others about your grace.__\n\n  *Teacher!

There is a word of comfort in 3:22-23 “Because of the Lord’s faithful love we do not perish,for His mercies never end. 23 They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness! I say: The Lord is my portion, therefore I will put my hope in Him.”\n  Jer. 40-44: Jeremiah was being led away in chains with the captives of Judah when the Babylonian captain of the guard released him and let him chose if he would go to Babylon or stay behind. He decided to stay in the land where Gedaliah was governor of Judah. Gedaliah told the people to not fear the Chaldeans. Many Judeans who had fled to surrounding areas came back to the land. Gedaliah was warned by Johanan that someone wanted to kill him, but he didn’t believe the report.\n  Ch. 41: Ishmael the Ammonite killed Gedaliah and those who had political connections in Judah. Johanan fought against Ishmael and rescued the people that Ishmael had taken captive. Johanan’s group wanted to run away to Egypt because they were afraid of the Chaldeans.\n  Ch. 42: The people asked Jeremiah to pray to God, in order to know if they should go to Egypt or not. After 10 days, Jeremiah shared that God told them not to go to Egypt. He told them not to fear the king of Babylon and that He wanted to show them mercy and save and deliver them. God warned them that those who went to Egypt would encounter war, famine and plague.\n  Ch. 43: However, Johanan said that Jeremiah was lying and led the remnant of Judah to Egypt. He made Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch go to Egypt with them. God told Jeremiah that Babylon would conquer Egypt and burn their temples.\n  Ch. 44: Jeremiah spoke to the Judeans in Egypt. He said that they shouldn’t worship the Egyptian idols. But the people said that they wanted to worship the idols. Then God said that he would punish them.\n\n  2 Kings 25:22-30: Gedaliah was appointed by Nebuchadnezzar as governor of Judah and told the people not to fear the Chaldeans (people from Babylon). But he was killed and a group ran away to Egypt because they were afraid of the Chaldeans (see Jer. 43:4-7).\n  In “the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, in the year Evil-merodach became king of Babylon, he pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison.” (v. 27).\nCharacter:\n- God is Judge\n- God is Faithful\n- God is our Defence\n- God is merciful\n- He fulfills His Word\n- God warns His people\n- He gives hope\n- He is our portion\nApplication: |\n  God was faithful to warn the people and call them to repentance. He is also faithful to speak to me through His Word. The people didn’t want to hear God’s Word and called Jeremiah a liar Jesus, help me to believe and follow Your Word. Jeremiah suffered at the hands of evil people who didn’t believe God’s Word but God helped Him just as He promised. Maybe some people also treat me poorly because I believe in Jesus and talk about Him. But I know that Jesus is always with me. He is my help. Jesus even said “You are blessed when they insult and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me. 12 Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you “ (Matt. 5:11-12).\n  Jeremiah knew that God is the most important and that He is worthy of his obedience. I also believe that Jesus is the most important and He is worthy of my obedience. He gave His life for me and forgives my sin. I know that He loves me and I love Him! In Lamentations 3:24, Jeremiah said that God is His portion and that he put his hope in HIm. Even when Jeremiah’s homeland was destroyed and he was taken away to Egypt, he knew that God was his portion and hope. This world changes all the time, but God’s kingdom is eternal and He has a reward, a portion, an inheritance and a place prepared for all those who love Jesus. We have a living hope (1Pet. 1:3) in Christ Jesus. We are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Heb. 12:28) and are looking ahead for the city that endures (Heb. 13:14 ), the New Jerusalem, where we will be with Jesus forever.\n"}</script>

Most of the believers in the Ephesian church were Gentiles. (2:11-22).\n  Jesus is the head of believers and they make up a body where each one does their part and grow in love (4:15-16)\n  Believers love and respect one another: Believers should follow the example of Jesus. The Holy Spirit changes them (4:20-24). “And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.”(4:32). In all their relationships, believers should love and respect one another: husbands and wives, children and parents, workers and bosses. (5:21-6:9)\n  Jesus helps believers to stand in truth (and against the devil): Believers should, “be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” (6:10) Jesus gives believers all that they need to stand safe in the truth (6:10-20). Jesus gave believers protection (the armor of God). This protection is: truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation and the Word of God. All these help the believer to stand in the truth of their: 1)spiritual blessings 2)their salvation by grace 3) their unity with other believers in Christ 4) their love and respect for others.\n  Jesus gives us all that we need to stand against the devil. Believers pray in the Spirit for one another that God would help them to boldly share the Good News of Jesus (6:18-20).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- Jesus makes all believers one in Him\n- Jesus is the head of the Church\n- Jesus is our Protection\n- 'Jesus is: Salvation, Truth, the Good News, Righteousness'\n- Jesus gives believers a new heart by the Holy Spirit\nApplication: |\n  __Jesus, I trust You.

When it’s hard for me to love others or stand against sin, help me to turn to You for help. Remind me of the truth of the Bible, how You completed (“it is finished”) my salvation and forgiveness. You saved me by grace and gave me new life in You. You gave me the Holy Spirit so I can live pleasing to You and share with people about You. Thank you Jesus.__\n\n  The picture of the armor of God shows me Jesus and my new life in Him.\n\n  The belt of truth: Jesus and His ways are right. When I know Jesus and what pleases Him then that truth acts like a belt that helps my clothes to stay on right. When I know the truth, I won’t listen to the lies of the devil. What truth do I know from the Bible? (example: Jesus is the Only Saviour and I have spiritual blessings in Jesus Eph 1:3)\n\n  The breastplate of righteousness: Jesus is my righteousness. I am saved by grace and not by works (Eph 2:8). Knowing that Jesus is my righteousness works like a breastplate that protects my heart from wrong thoughts and pride. I remember that Jesus gave me salvation as a gift.\n\n  Feet ready wearing the gospel of peace: Salvation and forgiveness in Jesus is good news! Jesus is the Saviour of all who believe and He gives us unity and peace in Him! (2:17-22). I put on shoes to go somewhere more easily or faster. I want to know the good news about Jesus so I can be ready to share about Jesus and His love and salvation for all!\n\n  The shield of faith: I believe that Jesus saved me and now I am a child of God. When I’m having a hard time, I can boldly and with faith ask Jesus to help me and He will protect me like a shield and give me strength from the Holy Spirit to trust Him and know His love (3:12, 16-19).\n\n  The helmet of salvation: Jesus changes my thinking and my life. I love Jesus and want to live pleasing to Him. He helps me to put off the old way of life and start to live a new life in Christ. Just like a helmet protects the head, so salvation in Jesus protects my mind and His Spirit renews my thinking and my life (4:23-24).\n\n  The sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God: Jesus gave us the Bible, that is, the Word of God.

God wanted them to return to Him. Ezekiel  told them that they would still be in Babylon for a long time before they returned to the land of Israel. But he also said that God promised them a good future in the land, where there would be a united and not divided kingdom.\n\n  God spoke judgement against different nations, including Egypt (ch.29-32)\n  God called Ezekiel His watchman to pass on words of warning to Israel, such as:“Tell them: As I live”—the declaration of the Lord God—“I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked person should turn from his way and live. Repent, repent of your evil ways! Why will you die, house of Israel?” (33:11). God said that Israel’s leaders were like bad shepherds who didn’t care for the sheep. He promised to care for the people as a good shepherd and to give them a King who will care for them and be a Good Shepherd to them (34:11-31). God promised to cleanse the people from sin and give them a new heart and a new spirit (36:26). He promised to bring them back to the land to rebuild and replant, so that they would know that He is the Lord (36:36-38).\n\n  God also showed him dry bones and gave them life in order to explain that He brings life to people (37:1-14). “I will put My Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. I have spoken, and I will do it.” This is the declaration of the Lord.” (37:14).\n  Ch. 40-48: Ezekiel is shown a vision of the new temple. He sees the glory of the Lord return there. He is shown a gate for the Prince and given instructions for the priests. He sees water flowing from the temple. God tells him where each tribe should live and details about the city gates. Verse 35 says that\n  “…the name of the city from that day on will be: Yahweh Is There.”\n\nCharacter:\n- God is glorious! He is worthy of worship\n- God is merciful\n- God punishes sin\n- God gives life\n- Jesus is King and the Good Shepherd\n- He fulfills God’s Word\n- God is the Righteous Judge\n- He gives believers a new heart\nApplication: |\n  God spoke to Ezekiel and showed him many amazing visions of His glory and His plans for people. God also speaks to me through the Bible about His plans for me and other people. When I read about Him, I remember that He is worthy of worship.\n  Israel fell into captivity because of their sin but God was merciful to them and later brought them back to the land. When I live my own way and sin, things are bad for me and I distance myself from God. But when I ask Jesus for forgiveness, He cleanses my heart and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. Without God, people are like dry bones but Jesus gives eternal life! Just as He promised in His Word, God returned His people to the land of Israel and they were one kingdom again. Also, just as God promised, He sent Jesus who is King and the Good Shepherd for Israel and for all who trust Him. Now, Jesus reigns in heaven and rules in the hearts of believers. Soon, He will come to earth again and will reign here so that all would know that He is King. __Jesus, please help me to tell people now that You are the Eternal King and the Good Shepherd. Help me to invite people to come to church or to read the Bible with me so that they could know You.__\n"}</script>

Because of Him I have suffered\n  the loss of all things and consider them filth, so that I may gain Christ 9 and\n  be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law, but one that\n  is through faith in Christ  -the righteousness from God based on faith.”\nSummary: |\n  (see Acts 16:11-40 about how God saved people in Philippi)\n  Ch. 1: Paul wrote from prison in Rome. He took joy in the Philippians’ faith and wanted them to grow in love and to be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes from Jesus Christ. God used Paul’s imprisonment so that more people would hear about Jesus (v. 12-14). Paul lived for Jesus, so that more people would know Him but was ready to die for Jesus and  see HIm face to face (v. 21-25).\n\n  Ch. 2: Jesus is our example in everything. He humbled Himself out of love and believers do so as well. Jesus is greater than all. Paul wanted believers to hold on to the Word of life (v. 16).\n\n  Ch. 3: Paul warned believers about false teachings. He wanted them to believe correctly about Jesus and not to listen to those who think in a worldly way. “But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. “ (3:20-21).\n\n  Ch. 4: “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. 5 Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; 6 do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n  8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. 9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.” (4:4-9). Paul trusted Jesus in all situations and wrote, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (4:13). He thanked the church for their help towards him and wrote, “And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (4:19).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- Jesus is greater than all\n- Jesus is humble\n- He gives peace and guards the hearts of believers\n- He is our joy\n- He gives believers a heavenly dwelling\n- He is a support in trials\n- He is righteous\nApplication: |\n  Paul wrote this joyful letter from prison. Because Paul was in prison, he could share the gospel with different people. He was ready to live and die for Jesus, trusting Jesus in any situation. I also want to trust Jesus when everything is going well as well as when it is difficult. Jesus suffered because of love for me. Now, He is in glory. Maybe things are difficult for me right now, but I know that one day I will be with Jesus. My citizenship is in heaven! I have a permanent place to live there with Jesus.\n  Even in difficulties and suffering, I can have joy in Jesus. He gives me peace and wants me to share everything with Him and give it to Him. Jesus doesn’t want me to worry but rather wants me to trust Him in everything and even to thank Him when I pray to Him. Maybe I am not thankful for a painful situation but I can be thankful to Jesus that He is with me and He understands me and helps me.\n  __Jesus, help me to think about, “whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise” (4:8). You, Jesus are true and You are honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, excellent and worthy of praise. You are my joy. Teach me to be joyful in You all the time. __\n\n  *Teacher!

Daniel and his friends were some of those people. King Nebuchadnezzar had a special plan for Daniel and his friends. He wanted them to serve in his kingdom and wanted them to study the ways for Babylon for 3 years. He also gave them food from his table. But Daniel and his friends couldn’t eat the king’s food because it wasn’t clean according to God’s law. When Daniel asked to only eat vegetables and drink water, God gave them favor with the person in charge of them. He decided to test them for 10 days and the Babylonians saw that Daniel and his friends looked better than those who were eating the king’s food. Daniel and his friends continued to study and God gave them wisdom and knowledge. At the end of the 3 years, the king tested them and saw that Daniel and his friends were the best.\n\n  Ch. 2: King Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream. He wanted to know what it meant. He wanted his wise men to tell him his dream and if they couldn’t, he would kill all of them. Daniel and his friends prayed to God for help. God told Daniel the king’s dream and it’s meaning. In the dream, there was a big statue made of different metals. In the end, a big rock destroyed the statue and became a big mountain that filled the earth. Daniel explained that the different metals were different kingdoms. The big Rock was God’s eternal kingdom that would destroy all the other ones and endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar said that Daniel’s God was the best and rewarded Daniel and his friends with good jobs serving him.\n\n  Ch. 3: King Nebuchadnezzar made a huge idol and gathered the leaders from his kingdom so that they would worship it when the music played. The friends of Daniel: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were there. They did not worship the idol. Other people complained about them to the king. The king gave them another chance to bow to the idol and if not, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. But they said that their God could save them and even if He did allow them to die, they wouldn’t worship the idol. The king got angry and heated the furnace 7 times hotter. It was so hot that the people who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the furnace died from the heat. The king saw that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn’t die but that God saved them and that even One who looked like the Son of God was with them in the fire. He told them to come out and saw that even their hair and clothing was not burned by the fire. Then the king praised God and wanted all his people to respect God (v. 28-29).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is wise\n- God gives mercy, wisdom and grace\n- God is always with us (omnipresent)\n- God is a glorious King\n- God’s kingdom is eternal\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- God hears everything\n- God sees everything\n- God is jealous\n- He is God of everyone in the whole world\nApplication: |\n  Daniel and his friends trusted God and did what was pleasing to Him. They loved God and that’s why they didn’t want to eat the king’s food.  Jesus, help me to follow You even when “important” people are telling me to do something else. People saw that following God was good. Jesus is glorified (seen as great) in my life when I follow Him.\n  Daniel knew that God knows everything and that He rules over and controls everything. He knew that God could tell him the king’s dream. The king then understood that God is the greatest. When I follow Jesus and look to Him for help, others see that He is great. Jesus is the big rock in the king’s dream that will get rid of all the other kingdoms and rule forever. He is big and strong and He rules over everything and everyone__. Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because You are great and Your kingdom is forever.__\n  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in a very difficult situation. In the face of death, they chose to worship God alone. When I am in difficult circumstances, Jesus helps me to not compromise or do what is displeasing to God. The One like the Son of God was with them in the furnace. Jesus, the Son of God, is with me when unbelievers threaten me. Often, when I follow Jesus, unbelievers will understand later that God is great and worthy of praise.\n"}</script>

He traveled with Paul and other believers to share about Jesus and teach the church.\n\n  1 Tim.1: Paul wanted Timothy to be in Ephesus and charged people to not spread false teaching.\n  1 Tim. 2: He wrote that it’s important to pray for all, that women should dress modestly and have self-control, showing their love for Jesus through their deeds.\n  1 Tim. 3: Paul describes the characteristics of a church leader. “Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness:He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations,believed on in the world, taken up in glory.” (1 Tim. 3:16)\n  1 Tim. 4: Paul wanted Timothy to hold on to the truth about Jesus and teach it to others.\n  1 Tim. 5: He wrote about how people in church should treat one another. “The sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgement, but the sins of others appear later. 25 So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.“ (1 Tim. 5:24-25).\n  1 Tim. 6: “But godliness with contentment is great gain, 7 for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. 8 But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content“ (1 Tim. 6:6-8). Paul again warns about false teachings and wrong attitudes towards money. “But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses“ (1 Tim. 6:11-12). “ As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.“ (1 Tim. 6:17).\n  \n  Titus \n  You may read about Titus in 2 Cor. 7:6, 13-14, 8:16, 23; Gal. 2:1. He traveled with Paul and other believers just like Timothy. He taught and served in Corinth. Paul wrote him when Titus was in Crete (Titus 1:5).\n  \n  Titus 1: Paul wanted Titus to set up church leaders. He wrote, so Titus would know what a church leader’s character should be like. “For an overseer, as God’s steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 9 He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.“ (Titus 1:7-9).\n  Titus 2: Paul wrote that it’s important to teach the truth and not false teaching. Believers of all ages should love Jesus and live in purity. “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.“ (Titus 2:11-14).\n  Titus 3: “But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life“ (Titus 3:4-7). Now believers have new life through faith in Jesus and do good works.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God can never lie\n- He saved us according to His mercy and justified us by grace\n- He gives true eternal life\n- Jesus is the KIng Eternal, immortal, invisible and God only wise\n- He is worthy of honor and eternal glory\n- Jesus saved believers, cleansed them and gives them His Holy Spirit (Titus 3:4-8)\nApplication: |\n  Jesus is the head of the church and He wants leaders in the church to love Him and follow Him. What characteristics of a leader are described in 1 Timothy and Titus? How can I have these characteristics? Only Jesus can change my heart and help me to be honest, loving and humble. Because Jesus saved me, I want to love God and others through good works. My works don’t save me. Only God’s grace and mercy save me. I want to express my love for God to people with my life.\n  Paul often warned about false teachings. __Jesus, help me to hold on to the words of the BIble and to correctly understand that You save by grace and change my heart. Help me to discern when I hear wrong teaching and to remember what the Bible teaches and pass on the truth to others. Guard me from deception, Jesus. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit and show me how to live for You and love others. When they see my good works, I want them to praise You, Jesus.__\n\n  *Teacher!

The Holy Spirit gave Daniel understanding of the meaning of the king’s dream. Daniel told the king that he should repent (that is stop acting his own way and start going God’s way). In time, the king forgot about the dream and was proud. God humbled him for a time, until he understood that God is the most important (v. 22-23 ). Later, the king praised God and understood that He can humble the proud and that God is right in all that He does (v. 34).\n  Then Belshazzar saw a hand (and only a hand!) which wrote mysterious words (a riddle) on the wall. The king was very frightened and promised to rewards the person who could explain the riddle. God helped Daniel to understand the words and explain them to Belshazzar. He told him that although Belshazzar knew what happened with Nebuchadnezzar (when God humbled him), he didn’t learn from the example and decided to exalt himself  before God (v.20-23). God told Belshazzar through the words on the wall that He was not pleased with Him and that He would take the kingdom from him. That very night, God did as He said. Belshazzar was killed and Darius the Mede became ruler of the kingdom.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is the most important\n- He is Lord\n- He reigns\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He warns people\n- He is merciful\n- God loves the humble\n- God has all authority\n- The Holy Spirit gives understanding and wisdom\n- God is King Eternal\n- He is unchanging\n- God knows all hearts\nApplication: |\n  God saw that Nebuchadnezzar’s heart was inclined towards pride and in His mercy, warned him to be humble. God explained this to him though his humble servant, Daniel. God also warns me through His Word to repent and live His way. Nebuchadnezzar forgot God’s Word and started to think that he was the most important. I also forget, and this is why it’s important to abide in the Word every day. Jesus, give me a desire to read the Bible and teach me when I read it. God humbled the king until he admitted that God has all authority. Even though I may not like it, it’s good when God humbles me. __Help me, Lord, to understand that You are the greatest and most important.__\n  Belshazzar didn’t learn from Nebuchadnezzar’s example. He didn’t fear (respect/honor/reverence) God and that’s why God took the kingdom from him. God can take something from me to teach me to respect Him. He sees my heart and knows everything. Jesus, give me a heart that loves You, respects You and knows that You are the greatest. Daniel trusted God and always gave God the glory. The Holy Spirit gave him wisdom. The Holy Spirit can give me wisdom. Through Daniel, God told people that He is the most important and the greatest. God, fill me with Your Holy Spirit and help me to tell people that Jesus is the most important and the greatest.\n"}</script>

He wrote letters to believers in different areas.\n\n  Ch. 1: He wrote that believers are born again and have an incorruptible inheritance and living hope through faith in Jesus. Difficulties and suffering test and strengthen their faith. Believers live holy lives and not according to the flesh, “ knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.“ (1:18-19). Their faith and reliance is upon God, that Jesus will come to save their souls. They are born of the Word of God (1:23). “The Word of the Lord endures forever” (1:25)\n\n  Ch. 2: Believers don’t reject the Word of God, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 10 Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.“ (2:9-10). Believers submit to the authorities. Sometimes believers suffer as Jesus suffered, “ For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.“ (2:21).\n\n  Ch. 3: Peter wrote about how wives and husbands should love and respect one another. Believers should love others and be humble. Sometimes they suffer for doing good, “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit“ (3:18). In water baptism, believers turn to God that He would cleanse their conscience through faith in the resurrection of Jesus (3:21).\n\n  Ch. 4: Believers don’t live according to the selfish flesh but in holiness. Peter wrote, “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.“ (4:8). Believers shouldn’t be surprised when they suffer for their faith. “If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you“ (4:14). They can trust God.\n\n  Ch. 5: Peter wanted leaders to care for other believers as shepherds. Jesus Himself is the chief Shepherd. “Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you“ (5:6). “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. 10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you“ (5:8-10).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is the God of all grace\n- Jesus is Savior\n- Jesus is the blameless and pure Lamb\n- His blood is precious\n- God gave believers eternal life and an inheritance in heaven\n- God calls people to Himself\n- He cares for His own\n- Jesus is coming again\n- God fulfills His Word and promises\nApplication: |\n  In Jesus, I have a living hope. I know that He will come to take me to Himself to live eternally with Him in heaven. When life here is difficult, I can remember that I have a heavenly inheritance (eternal life with Jesus) awaiting me. I expect His return.  I am thankful that He paid for my sin with His own blood and this is why I want to live in purity as I wait for Jesus.\n   It’s important for me to know what God says to me in the Word because the Word is eternal. In the Word, I can find out the truth and promises of God. Through the Bible I can come to know Jesus better. I trust the Bible and want to read it every day.__ Jesus, teach me when I read the Bible. Show me how to live according to Your Word.__\n  People without Jesus live however they want and sin against God. Their behavior is very dangerous and they harm themselves and those around them. Jesus helps me to live holy because He gave me the Holy Spirit. I rely upon His strength to live pleasing to God. He helps me to love others. When people see that I love others, they can understand how Jesus loves them. __Jesus, help me to be loving.__\n  People without God don’t like it that believers in Jesus don’t do what they do or don’t approve of what they do. They can be against me and persecute me because of my faith in Jesus. Even when I suffer because of faith in Jesus, I can be joyful. Jesus is with me. He also went through a difficult path. With His help, I can follow His example and remember the living hope and the heavenly inheritance that awaits me. He is my joy. I rely upon Him.\n\n  *Teacher!

The king was thinking about making Daniel head over the kingdom. There were some people who envied Daniel and wanted to get rid of him. But Daniel was a god-fearing person and they couldn’t find anything bad in him. Then they made a plan and gave the king an idea to make a law that for 30 days, people could only pray to the king (not to God). But Daniel loved God and continued to pray to God alone even when he heard about the law. The tricky people caught Daniel when he was praying and as a punishment threw him into the lion’s den.  The king wanted to free Daniel but he couldn’t change his law. He said “may your God save you!” That night, the king couldn’t sleep and in the morning he came to the lion’s den to see if Daniel was still alive. Daniel said “God sent an angel who closed the mouth of the lions.” God saved Daniel because he trusted in HIm (v.23). Later, the king commanded that all people in his kingdom should fear God and know that He saves.\n\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King Eternal\n- His Kingdom is Forever\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is Protector\n- God hears our prayers\n- God is Savior\n- He is always with us\nApplication: |\n  Daniel served before many different kings when he lived in Babylon. He saw that their kingdoms were only temporary. He knew that God is the great King and that His kingdom is forever. He followed God above all and did not compromise when man’s law contradicted (went against) God’s law. God showed Daniel that the Messiah’s kingdom would never end (2:44) and showed him what would happen before Jesus’ kingdom was fully established (ch. 9).\n  It may happen that evil people don’t like me and want to get me into trouble. I can trust God and follow Him like Daniel did. Even if they do something bad to me, Jesus is with me and I know that I belong to Him and His kingdom. Earthly kingdoms will all end someday, but Jesus’ kingdom is forever.\n"}</script>

Jesus is greater than the prophets. Jesus is God. “The Son is the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of His nature, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.4 So He became higher in rank than the angels, just as the name He inherited is superior to theirs.” 1:3-4. Jesus is Creator. He is greater than the angels, the angels are a part of creation that serve believers in Jesus (1:14).\n\n  Ch. 2 We should not fall away from the truth, but hold on to it. Jesus conquered the devil and freed believers. He Himself endured temptation and can help those who are tempted (2:18).\n\n  Ch.3 Jesus is greater than Moses, who led the people out of slavery and through the wilderness. God wanted to give them rest but some people didn’t trust God and that is why they could not enter into His rest (3:19).\n\n  Ch. 4 Jesus is greater than Joshua, who led the people into the promised land. Through faith, we can enter into God’s rest. “Let us then make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience. 12 For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the ideas and thoughts of the heart.” 4:11-12. Jesus is our High Priest. “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tested in every way as we are, yet without sin. 16 Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us at the proper time.” 4:15-16.\n\n  Ch. 5 Jesus is God’s Son. He is greater than the High Priest. In the Old Testament there was a priest by the name of Mechidezek. He was a type of Jesus (5:9). According to the Law, only the sons of Aaron could be priests in Israel, but Jesus is a High Priest in the order of Melchidezek. The author wanted believers to understand the truth and become mature (5:14).\n\n  Ch. 6 God wants people to trust His Word and promises. There is hope in Jesus, “We have this hope as an anchor for our lives, safe and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain” (6:19). *behind the curtain = the holy place where God is\n\n  Ch. 7 Jesus is the Eternal Priest. He lives forever to intercede for believers. Jesus is the better hope and guarantee of a better covenant. “Therefore, He is always able to save those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.” (7:25). Jesus gave Himself as a sacrifice for sin once and for all.\n\n  Ch. 8: Jesus intercedes for believers as a priest in heaven. The old covenant was a shadow of the new covenant which Jesus perfected.\n\n  Ch. 9: In the Old Testament, there was the tabernacle where people worshipped God. At that time,  the high priest brought the blood into the holy of holies once a year for the forgiveness of sins, but Jesus paid for sin by bringing His own blood into God the Father’s presence and obtained eternal redemption for people (9:12 and 24). “… without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.“ (9:22). “And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment— 28 so also the Messiah, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.“ (9:27-28).\n\n  Ch. 10: The Law pointed to Jesus; the Law doesn’t save. The blood of animals could not pay for sin. Believers become holy once and for all through the sacrifice of Jesus. He is now in heaven at the right hand of God the Father. He forgave believers and this is why sacrifices are no longer needed.\n  Believers can go to God through faith in Jesus and His sacrifice for them. “ let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. 23 Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. 24 And let us be concerned about one another in order to promote love and good works, 25 not staying away from our worship meetings, as some habitually do, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day drawing near.“ (10:22-25).\n  Knowing this truth, believers shouldn’t sin or fear difficulties and suffering for their faith. The author writes, “So don’t throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.“ (10:35). Jesus is coming again and thinking about this, believers should stand in faith in HIm. (10:37).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- He is now at the right hand of God the Father\n- He is the Lamb of God\n- He is Savior\n- He is the High Priest\n- He never sinned\n- His sacrifice paid once and for all for sin\n- Jesus gives forgiveness\n- He intercedes for believers\n- He lives forever\n- Jesus gives us access to God\n- He is coming soon\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is the Son of God. He is greater than the prophets, the angels, Moses, Joshua and the High Priests. Everything in the Old Testament (the Law, the tabernacle, the sacrifices and the priesthood) point to Jesus. I deserve death and punishment for my sin against the Holy God. People earlier brought sacrifices of animals according to the law so that the blood of the animal would cover their sin. But the priests needed to constantly bring sacrifices for themselves and the people because the blood of animals could not give them a new heart and new relationship with God. Jesus is God and man. He never sinned and gave Himself as a sacrifice for my sin. This is why He is the perfect sacrifice and could pay for my sin once and for all. He always lives to intercede for me.\n   How does this truth change my life? I trust the sacrifice of Jesus for my salvation and not my works according to the law. He gives me rest through faith in His sacrifice. He helps me to love others and trust the Word. When I’m scared and people are against me, I can stand firm in my faith in Jesus. I know that He is the One Savior. I know that He is my Salvation. I know that He will come soon and I will be with Him forever. __Jesus, You are a Great Savior. Thank you for Your perfect sacrifice. Help me to stand firm in faith even when I suffer because of it. Thank you that through Jesus, I can come boldly to God for grace and help. You live forever and are always my help. Praise to You!__\n"}</script>

For we are not presenting our petitions before\n  You based on our righteous acts, but based on Your abundant compassion.”'\nSummary: |+\n  Ch. 7: Daniel had a dream where there were 4 animals. One had 10 horns and then one horn became greater. Later, Daniel saw the throne of God where He judged and gave all authority to the Son of Man. Daniel didn’t understand what God showed him and asked to know the meaning. God explained that the animals represented different kingdoms that would rule for a time but that God and His people would reign forever in His kingdom (v. 27).\n  Ch. 8: Daniel had a vision of a ram and a goat fighting. Again he saw a horn that “…will throw truth to the ground and will be successful in whatever it does” (v. 12). God sent the angel Gabriel to explain the vision to Daniel. The horn is an evil ruler in the last days, whom God will judge. Daniel felt ill because he didn’t understand everything and it was all very serious.\n  Ch. 9: Daniel prayed to God and asked forgiveness for himself and his people who were in captivity for 70 years. God again sent Gabriel to Daniel and answered his prayer. He told Daniel about the 70 weeks in the last days.\n  Ch. 10: God strengthened Daniel, who was weak in the presence of God and His angels.\n  Ch. 11: God revealed to Daniel very detailed political information about different kings and the last days.\n  Ch. 12: God told Daniel that there would be tribulation in the last days, judgement and the salvation for the people of Israel (v. 1). He also spoke of resurrection: “Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt.” (v.2).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is King Eternal\n- Jesus is the Son of Man\n- God hears the prayers of His people\n- God answers prayer\n- God is Sovereign\n- God has an eternal plan\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God is unchanging\n- God is Judge\nApplication: |\n  God has a good plan for us. He knows everything that happens and guides everyone. He has an eternal plan to save believers and to judge nonbelievers. What do I believe about Jesus? Do I believe that He is King and that He has an eternal kingdom? Do I know that I belong to His kingdom? Only through faith in Jesus Christ can I have forgiveness from God and become His child. Daniel trusted God and sought to give God glory in everything. I also can live for Jesus’ glory because he helps me with the Holy Spirit.\n  The last days will be scary for those who don’t believe in Jesus. I want to tell people about salvation in Jesus so that He would give them the gift of eternal life. Daniel prayed to God and asked forgiveness for himself and for his people. I also can pray to God and trust in His mercy and righteousness. I don’t have any righteousness of my own, but I believe that Jesus, the Righteous One paid for my sins and that He gives me strength to live God’s way.\n"}</script>

Many people lived by faith and in their lives made decisions that showed that God was the most important and that they expected eternal life with God after life on earth (11:10). They lived their lives knowing that things on earth are temporary, “ But they now desire a better place—a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.“ (11:16).\n\n  Ch. 12: “Therefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares us. Let us run with endurance the race that lies before us, 2 keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that lay before Him endured a cross and despised the shame and has sat down at the right hand of God’s throne.“ (12:1-2). God the Father disciplines His own so they will share in His holiness (12:10). His discipline teaches us what is right and results in righteousness. “ Make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up, causing trouble and by it, defiling many“ (12:15). Believers should remember that they  don’t come to God through the Law of the old covenant but through the blood of Jesus Christ in the new covenant. People shouldn’t turn away from God, who speaks to them.  Grace helps believers to serve God. They are thankful that they are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken. (12:28).\n\n  Ch. 13: Believers live by faith: love one another, care for those who suffer, live in purity and the author wrote: “Your life should be free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for He Himself has said, I will never leave you or forsake you. 6 Therefore, we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?“ (13:5-6). Believers follow the example of mature believers remembering that, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever” (13:8). They don’t listen to false teaching but remember that salvation is by grace. Jesus Himself suffered that believers could be with God. They are ready to suffer for the sake of faith in Jesus, “For we do not have an enduring city here; instead, we seek the one to come.“ (13:14). “Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus—the great Shepherd of the sheep—with the blood of the everlasting covenant, 21 equip you with all that is good to do His will, working in us what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ. Glory belongs to Him forever and ever.] Amen.“ (13:20-21).\nCharacter:\n- God rewards those who seek Him\n- He is preparing a city for them\n- God is the most valuable and most important\n- Jesus is the Savior who endured the cross\n- Jesus is the Author and Finisher of our faith\n- He sits at the right hand of God the Father\n- God the Father disciplines those that He loves, that they would be partakers of\n  His holiness\n- God is a God of peace\n- Jesus is the Great Shepherd\n- God perfects believers in every good deed\nApplication: |\n  The Bible is full of vivid examples of people who trusted God with their lives. Their examples help me to understand what “faith” means. Faith is my trust in Jesus and in what He promises (which is unseen, such as life in heaven or my justification), that is visible in my actions (how I live, what I value and what decisions I make). I believe that Jesus’ blood paid for my sin and that He is coming again and I will live with HIm forever. This is why as I make decisions now, I think about eternity with Jesus. I am not afraid to say that I’m a believer in Jesus or to act honestly when I know that others will be unhappy. My reward will be in heaven and not now. That which Jesus offers eternally is so much better than what the world offers.\n  __Jesus, help me to remember Your sacrifice and victory for me. Help me to live thinking about eternity and to make decisions that are pleasing to You. Thank You God, that you are a loving, Heavenly Father who disciplines me when I do something wrong in order to correct me and teach me to trust in You, so I can share in Your holiness. You love me so much! I trust that there is always a reason and wisdom in what You do in my life.Thank you that I can be with You in Your kingdom! I know that there will be joy in Your presence. Help me every day to follow You, love You and others and not forget about Your grace. You are my Shepherd and you care for me. Jesus, You perfected my salvation. I love You.__\n"}</script>

You created the heavens, the highest heavens\n  with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in\n  them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly host worships You.” or Haggai\n  1:13 “Haggai, the Lord’s messenger, delivered the Lord’s message to the people,\n  “I am with you”—this is the Lord’s declaration.”\nSummary: |+\n  God had brought the people back from captivity, as He promised.”When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. 2 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing” (Ps.126:1-2).\n\n  Haggai: The people returned to the land, had started to rebuild the temple and then stopped rebuilding. God told them through the prophet Haggai that He wasn’t blessing them because they hadn’t made Him their priority (1:4-5). The people listened to God and started to rebuild the temple and God blessed them (1:12-13). The prophet encouraged their leader, Zerubbabel, and the people to rebuild. He reminded them that God was with them. God said ““The final glory of this house  will be greater than the first,” says the Lord of Hosts. “I will provide peace in this place”—this is the declaration of the Lord of Hosts” (2:9). He promised to shake the Gentile kingdoms and make Zerubbabel His chosen one (2:23).\n\n  Ezra: ch. 1: God fulfilled His Word that He spoke through the prophet Isaiah that a king named Cyrus would give a command that the Israelites in captivity could return to their land and restore their temple in Jerusalem. (see Is. 44:24-28 through Is. 45:1-7).\n\n  2 Chron. 36:22-23: “ In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, the word of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The Lord put it into the mind of King Cyrus of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his entire kingdom and also to put it in writing: 23 This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build Him a temple at Jerusalem in Judah. Whoever among you of His people may go up, and may the Lord his God be with him.”\n\n\nCharacter:\n- God speaks His will\n- ' He fulfills His Word'\n- God is faithful\n- God is our help\n- God has all authority\n- God is Holy\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God gives peace\n- Jesus is the Eternal King\n- God’s kingdom is forever\nApplication: |\n  I know that when God promises, He fulfills His Word. I can read the Bible and know that His Word is true. Jesus helps me to fulfill God’s Word just as God helped the people to rebuild the temple when He told them too. Sometimes people are against God’s word but nothing can stop God. God helps me to fulfill His Word. I can praise God not only in church, but everywhere. I can sing to God and thank Him for His love which He shows me in Christ Jesus.\n\n  In Haggai, God wrote a lot about Zerubbabel, the person who led the people back to the land of Israel from Babylon (Ezra 2:2). He is important because though him, God fulfilled His promise to David and to us to send a Messiah. Zerubbabel is in the genealogy of Jesus (see Matt. 1:12, Lk. 3:27). Although God’s people were in Babylon for 70 years, God kept the line of David alive and returned them to the land. Why is this important for me? I see that God always fulfills His Word and Him promises to me in the Bible. He is my Savior and King. He keeps me and can use my life, so that more people would know about the salvation and forgiveness that Jesus gives. I have become a part of God’s family through faith in Jesus. God also promises to shake heaven and earth and all the kingdoms. He will set up His eternal kingdom where Jesus will reign forever (2:6-9, 20-23).\n  Psalm 126 speaks about the people’s joy in returning to Israel and says, “He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.” (Ps. 126:6). I can share with people that Jesus is Saviour to those who trust Him and that He is Judge to those who do not trust Him. This can be like planting seeds. It is not easy to tell people the truth and sometimes they don’t like what they hear. But after the seeds of truth are planted, God makes them grow and  there is a “harvest” of souls who know Jesus. Those who planted rejoice. In the same way, God causes His Word to bring life to people’s hearts when they believe in Jesus. There is a harvest of people gathered to Jesus. This is very joyful! Lord Jesus, use me to share with people that you are Saviour. You said: “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 __Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matt 9:37). You are coming soon, Lord Jesus, help me to love you with all my heart, soul and strength and to share your love and salvation with people.__\n"}</script>

Paul was in prison because of his faith in Christ Jesus and said, “So don’t be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me His prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God.9 He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.“ (1:8-9). He wanted Timothy to continue following the truth and right teaching. Many people left Paul but he was thankful to those who helped him.\n\n  Ch. 2: Paul wanted Timothy to pass on the truth to others and to be a good worker. “You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2 And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.“ (2:1-2). “Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth.“ (2:15).\n\n  Ch. 3: Timothy followed Paul’s example. The last days will be hard; people will love their own pleasures and not God (3:9).  “ In fact, all those who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.“(3:12). Paul exhorts Timothy to hold on to God’s Word which teaches about salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. “All Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, 17 so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.“ (3:16-17).\n\n  Ch. 4: Paul wanted Timothy to teach others the truth. Paul knew that he would soon die for his faith in Jesus but was confident that he had lived rightly before God and awaited the reward from Jesus in His kingdom. Paul wanted Timothy and Mark to come to him soon (4:9 and 11). Luke (author of the gospel of Luke and the book of Acts) was with Paul. When Paul stood in court for his faith, God was with him, strengthened him and helped him to share the gospel (4:17). He knew that God would keep him for His heavenly kingdom.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- He abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel\n  (2 Tim 1:10)\n- He promises life\n- God gives gifts and the Spirit of power, love and sound mind\n- He is coming again\n- He rose from the dead\n- Jesus is from the seed of David\n- He is faithful\n- God knows His own\n- The Holy Spirit lives in believers (1:14)\n- Jesus has a kingdom\n- He is Judge and will judge the living and the dead at the revelation of His kingdom\n- God rewards believers in His kingdom\nApplication: |\n  Paul gave instructions to Timothy, a young leader in the church. I can apply what he wrote him to myself. It’s important for me to follow the truth, read the Bible and pass on the truth to others. Paul suffered for his faith in Jesus and said that all believers in some way will be persecuted for following Jesus (3:12). Paul knew that he would die soon for his faith in Jesus but he awaited a crown of righteousness in heaven. He thought of the good things that awaited him in heaven. He wanted Timothy to continue to believe in the truth of the Bible. I believe that the Bible is from God and that it is the truth which guides my life. I want to better know and fulfill what is written there.

Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!\n  Look, your King is coming to you; He is righteous and victorious, humble and riding\n  on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.”\nSummary: |+\n  God spoke to Israel through the prophet Zechariah: “Return to Me…and I will return to you, says the Lord of Hosts” (v.3). The 70 years of Babylonian captivity had ended and according to God’s Word, the people returned to the land of Israel! God gave Zechariah 8 visions in the night about the restoration of Israel, showing them mercy and saying that the temple would be rebuilt. (1:13-17). God said that the day would come when He would cleanse His people and remove their sin (3:8-10). Regarding the restoration and rebuilding of the temple, He said, “So he answered me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,’ says the Lord of Hosts. 7 ‘What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. And he will bring out the capstone accompanied by shouts of: Grace, grace to it!’” (4:6-7).\n  God spoke of the Branch, who is the King and Priest (6:12-13). God told His people “make fair decisions. Show faithful love and compassion to one another.” (7:9). God spoke about the coming of the Messiah King (9:9, 14:9). 12:10 says that Israel will look upon the One they pierced and mourn.\n\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King\n- God fulfills His Word\n- The Holy Spirit is strong and mighty\n- Jesus was, is and is coming again\n- God restores and renews\n- God communicates His plan of salvation\n- God is merciful\n- God is gracious\nApplication: |\n  God is the One who renews me. The people of Israel were disobedient and for 70 years were in captivity in Babylon. Then, by God’s Word they returned to the land and God helped them to rebuild not only the temple but to rebuild their relationship with God and one another in a right way. When I believe in Jesus, He forgives my sin and renews my life. God has a good plan for me when I seek Him and follow Jesus. It’s good for me to remember that just as the people couldn’t rebuilt the temple in their own strength but God gave them help from the Holy Spirit to do it, so also I can’t live God’s way in my own strength but God gives me His Holy Spirit to live pleasing to Him. Everything is by His grace!\n  In the book of Zechariah, God says a lot about Jesus. We know that some of these verses have already been fulfilled because Jesus already came, lived on earth, died on the cross, rose from the dead and returned to heaven. But we are waiting for His second coming when He will take His own to be with Him, punish and judge the unbelievers and reign as King forever. I believe that Jesus is coming soon! I want to live each day for His glory and tell people about Him so that they won’t perish but will have eternal life through faith in Jesus. Jesus saves us by His grace.\n"}</script>

Amen.”\nSummary: |\n  Jude was the brother of James (see Matt. 13:55, Acts 15:13 and Gal. 1:19) and Jesus. Jude wrote this letter so that believers would stand for the faith. There were dishonest people in the church who 1) twisted the understanding of grace in order to live in worldly ways 2) rejected God as Master and Jesus Christ. He wrote that God would judge such people and gave examples from the Bible of how God earlier judged non-believers, unrighteous people and angels. There will be a judgement day (v. 6). “Nevertheless, these dreamers likewise defile their flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme glorious ones.“(verse 8), although even angels don’t speak against other angels but ask that God Himself would rebuke them (verse 9). Jude wrote how they are spiritually dead and don’t do what they should. They aren’t fulfilling the purpose for which they were created. They will be judged, as Scripture says (verse 15).\n  Jude wrote that believers should, “But you, dear friends, as you build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, expecting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life. 22 Have mercy on those who doubt, save others by snatching them from the fire; have mercy on others but with fear, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.” (20-23). God keeps believers pure in joy. God is the greatest and eternally worthy of praise.\nCharacter:\n- God the Father sanctifies believers\n- Jesus Christ guards believers\n- The Lord is Redeemer\n- God is a Righteous Judge\n- God can keep believers from falling\n- He makes believers stand in the presence of His glory, blameless and with great\n  joy\n- He is God Only Wise\n- Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior\n- Glory, glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time, now and forever belong\n  to God\nApplication: |\n  I understand that in the church there may be dishonest people who don’t want to follow Jesus and His Word. God will judge such people. God wants me to believe correctly about Jesus and live in purity. The Bible is the truth, and this is why it’s important to know what is written in it. Jude wrote about how I should treat people who have gone astray. I should show them mercy but be careful so that I don’t start to do what they are doing. Jude gave practical advice in verses 21-22:  I can build myself up in my most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit,  and keep myself in the love of God, expecting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ for eternal life. When I read the Bible and ask Jesus for help to wait in the Spirit and live pleasing to Him, He answers and helps me. Jesus is most important for me. He is my authority and my life. __Jesus, help me to hold on to the truth and always submit to You. Thank you that you keep me! You are faithful!__\n"}</script>

The people returned and started to  rebuild the temple and altar. They were stopped but then after some years, another king told them that they could build again. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah encouraged people to build. They finished rebuilding the temple and starting worshiping God there. They celebrated Passover.\n  Still, there were many Jews who  lived in the lands of their captivity and didn’t return to the land of Israel. Esther was a Jewess, who lived in the city of Susa, in the Persian Empire, where Ahasuerus was king (in some texts: Artaxerxes).\n  During a celebration, King Ahasuerus  asked his wife to come and dance for his guests. She refused and the king decided to take away her crown and find a new queen. There was a contest in the land and Esther, who was Jewish, became the new queen. Her uncle Mordechai worked for the king. He heard of a plan to kill the king and saved him. Haman was a prince in the land and wanted everyone to worship him. When he passed by Mordecai, he wanted him to bow to him. but Mordecai would only worship God. Haman got angry when he saw that Mordecai wouldn’t bow to him. He decided to kill Mordecai and all the Jews. He tricked the king into planning a certain day when all the Jews in his kingdom could be killed. Mordecai found out about this and tore his clothes as a sign of suffering and sadness. He spoke with Esther and asked her to talk with the king about her people. But Esther knew that if she went to the king without being invited, she could be killed. Mordecai said,“Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (4:14) Esther asked that all the Jews would fast for their salvation and decided to risk her life and said “if I perish, I perish!” (4:16).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- God is Defender\n- He sees everything\n- He is our Help\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- God guides our lives\nApplication: |\n  Mordecai and Esther believed God and served the king when it was a difficult time for their people. God gave them influence and a high position so that they could help people. Maybe God put me in a special place at a special time so that I can tell people about Jesus? God gives me boldness and wisdom to tell people about Jesus at home, at school and everywhere where people need to hear the truth. I trust in Jesus and know that He is the Saviour of all who trust in Him. When Jesus calls me to do something for Him for the sake of truth, it is worth taking a risk (just as Esther did).\n  God always supplies me with His strength, wisdom and love to fulfill His plan when I ask Him. The most important thing is to love God more than anything and listen to Him. For example, Mordecai didn’t bow down to worship Haman even though he knew that Haman had power. Esther also decided to go to the king even though she wasn’t invited. They trusted God. They also asked others to pray for them when things were difficult. I also can pray to God on behalf of other believers and ask them to pray for me too.\n  The Jews fasted and prayed before Esther went to talk with the king. When people fast, they feel hungry because their body needs food. When believers in Jesus fast, they are reminded that their hearts and souls need God. They draw near to God when they fast and look to Him to fill them up, not with food, but with His strength, love and wisdom. When believers fast, they humble themselves (make themselves low) and remember that they are dependent upon God (who is great!) for  everything in life!\n\n  *fun facts: 1) the city of Susa is in modern day Iran 2) King Darius from Daniel ch. 6 is the father of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes or Artaxerxes) in Esther. 3) the name of God is not mentioned directly in the book of Esther but some see it in acrostic form in the original text. that is, God’s name is hidden in the text.

God gives us everything needed for life and godliness in the knowledge of Him (1:3). He gave us great and precious promises (2 Pet.1:4). Peter knew that he would die soon but he wanted to write believers and remind them of this truth. He himself saw Jesus and all that he did (2 Pet. 1:16). Believers should believe the Word because it was given by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21).\n\n  2 Pet. 2: Peter warned about false teachers. God will judge them, just as He judged fallen angels and ungodly people (2 Pet. 2:4-6). But, “ …the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment“ (2 Pet. 2:9). False teachers, “…promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them“ (2 Pet. 2:19).\n\n  Peter wrote this letter to remind believers about the truth that Jesus is coming and then there will be a judgement day. There will be people who say that Jesus is not coming and that there will be no judgement. “The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance.10 But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief;  on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed“ (2 Pet. 3:9-10). This is why believers want to live in holiness. Everything on earth will burn and melt. “But based on His promise, we wait for the new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell.“ (2 Pet.3:13). Believers await the return of Jesus and want to be pure before Him in the world. Peter wanted believers to guard themselves from false teaching and said, “But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen“ (2 Pet.3:18).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus Christ is Savior\n- He is Lord\n- God by His divine power has given us everything required for life and godliness\n  through the knowledge of Him\n- ' He has called us by His own glory and goodness'\n- God gives free entrance into the Eternal Kingdom of the Lord Jesus\n- Jesus is the beloved Son of God the Father\n- The Holy Spirit inspired Scripture\n- Jesus is coming\n- He is the righteous Judge\n- He knows all and sees all\n- God wants all to come to repentance\n- God is patient\nApplication: |\n  I am thankful to God for all that He has given me.

I can know Him better when I read the Bible and live, serving Him in the Holy Spirit.__ Jesus, help me to grow in the knowledge of You and live according to the Word.__\n  There are false teachers who don’t live according to God’s Word and don’t submit to Jesus. God will judge them. I want to know the truth from the Bible and live in agreement with it. Jesus, guard me from lies and heresy. Help me to abide in the truth of the Word and share it with others.

She invited him and Haman to a banquet. Before the banquet, the king found out how Mordecai had saved his life earlier and commanded Haman to reward him. Later, at a second banquet, the king asked Esther how he could help her. She told him Haman’s plan to kill her people. The king was angry, killed Haman and helped the Jews to defend themselves against those who wanted to kill them.

The one who doesn’t have the Son of God\n  does not have life.“\nSummary: |\n  Ch. 1: John himself saw Jesus and fellowshiped with Him. He wanted other believers to also have fellowship with one another, with God the Father and with Jesus. He wrote this letter so that their joy would be complete (1:4). God is light. Believers walk in the light and have fellowship with God. The blood of Jesus cleanses from sin. All people sin, but “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1:9).\n\n  Ch. 2: John wrote this letter so that people wouldn’t continue in sin (2:1). But if someone sinned, Jesus intercedes for them. He is the propitiation for the sin of the whole world (the One who turned the wrath of God away and paid for sin with His blood). Believers can have confidence that they belong to God if they keep the Word and abide in Him. “The one who says he remains in Him should walk just as He walked.“ (2:6). Faith in Jesus changes how believers live.They love other believers when they love God. “Do not love the world or the things that belong to  the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. 16 For everything that belongs to the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride in one’s lifestyle—is not from the Father, but is from the world. 17 And the world with its lust is passing away, but the one who does God’s will remains forever.“ (2:15-17). The antichrist doesn’t believe in the Father and the Son. God promised believers eternal life, gave them an anointing and called them to be with Him. They abide in Him and are not ashamed in His presence. He is the Righteous One and those who do right things have received new life in Him.\n\n  Ch. 3: “ Look at how great a love the Father has given us that we should be called God’s children. And we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it didn’t know Him.“ (3:1). Believers live in purity and don’t sin because their hope is in Him. Jesus destroyed the works of the devil. Those who love God and other believers don’t continue sinning. Believers love one another. The world hates believers. Believers love their brothers and follow Jesus’ example. They love with actions and not only words. Believers believe in Jesus, abide in HIm, fulfill His commandments and know that He is in them because He gave them the Holy Spirit (3:24).\n\n  Ch. 4: False prophets don’t believe that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. There is a Spirit of truth and a spirit of deception. “Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent His One and Only Son into the world so that we might live through Him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. 11 Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another.“ (4:7-11).  God gave believers the Holy Spirit and we know that we abide in Him. “ Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God—God remains in him and he in God.“ (4:15). Believers don’t fear judgement day because they know that Jesus paid for their sin and His perfect love drives out all fear. “We love because He first loved us.“ (4:19).\n\n  Ch. 5: Believers believe in Jesus, love others and live according to God’s Word. “… whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith. 5 And who is the one who conquers the world but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?“ (5:4-5). “The one who has the Son has life. The one who doesn’t have the Son of God does not have life.“ (5:12). John wrote this letter to believers in Jesus so that they would know that they have eternal life (5:13). Believers have confidence that God answers their prayers when they pray according to God’s will. (5:14). Believers don’t continue sinning because God keeps them. “And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true One. We are in the true One—that is, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. Little children, guard yourselves from idols.“ (5:20-21).\nCharacter:\n- God is Father\n- Jesus is the only begotten Son of God\n- God is light and in Him is no darkness\n- The blood of Jesus cleanses from sin\n- God promised believers eternal life\n- Jesus is coming\n- He is the Righteous One\n- Jesus destroyed the works of the devil\n- Jesus came in the flesh\n- God is love\n- God first loved us\n- Jesus is the propitiation for sin (one who turns away the wrath of God)\n- Jesus is the true God and eternal life\nApplication: |\n  Believers believe in Jesus, love others and live according to the Word of God.  Do I believe in Jesus? Do I have confidence in my salvation? Do I love other believers? Do I live according to God’s Word?\n  When I believe in Jesus, I have fellowship with believers and with God. The way I live (pleasing to God or the way people in the world live) shows if I’m truly saved. Of course each person is a sinner and sins, but if I believe in Jesus and love HIm, I don’t continue sinning. For example, if I have a problem telling the truth and I constantly lie, I can ask Jesus to help me to speak the truth. He will help. But if I lie over and over again and don’t turn to Jesus for help then my salvation is under question. Do I understand the love of Jesus, His sacrifice on the cross and His power to help me live right?\n  When I am saved, I love other believers. I show my love not only in words but in actions. If I don’t love my brother (another believer). that means that I don’t understand and don’t have God’s love. __Jesus, show me my heart and give me love for You and others. I want to love you and other more and more. __\n"}</script>

Give Your servant\n  success today, and have compassion on him in the presence of this man”\nSummary: |2+\n\n  Ezra 7-8: Ezra “came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. 10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.” (7:9-10).The king gave Ezra special letter promising him help for teaching people to worship God. Many people decided to go back to Jerusalem with Ezra. They brought a lot of silver and gold articles for worship in the temple. They prayed and fasted to God for a safe  journey and God answered their prayer (8:21-23, 31).\n\n  Ezra 9-10:  Ezra heard that some people had married women who didn’t love God but who worshiped idols. He tore his clothes, pulled some hair from his beard, sat down in shock and didn’t eat until evening time. He prayed to God, admitting that the people were guilty He reminded the people of God sent them into exile and in His mercy brought them back to the land. Many people gathered around Ezra and started crying and confessing their sin (10:1-2). They decided to promise to follow God and not to have the wives that didn’t love God.  They gathered together on a very rainy day and decided to follow God.\n\n  Neh. 1 Nehemiah lived in Susa when he heard that his city, Jerusalem was still in ruins and the walls were still broken down. He cried before the Lord and prayed to Him. He confessed his sins and the sins of his people. He was the king’s cup bearer.\n  Neh. 2: When Nehemiah was serving him, the king noticed that Nehemiah’s face was sad. He wanted to know why and Nehemiah explained that his city was in ruins and that he wanted to rebuild the walls. The king allowed him to go to Jerusalem and provided the necessary materials for rebuilding.\n  Nehemiah examined the walls of Jerusalem at night. Later, he told the people that God had provided them with help from the king to rebuild the walls. The enemies heard their plan and started to laugh at them but Nehemiah told them that God would help His people (2:20).\n  Neh. 3: The people started to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is our help\n- God is our defence\n- God has a plan\n- God gives grace\n- God is generous\nApplication: |\n  Ezra taught people God’s Word so that they could know God. He was sad when he heard that people were not following God’s Word (when they married women who didn’t love God). The people were convicted of sin (realized that they were guilty), they confessed it (admitted their sin to God), they repented and obeyed God’s Word (followed God).\n  *Idea for teaching: use gestures to teach the key words: convicted, confession, repentance and obedience. Convicted (strike your heart with your finger, like an arrow is piercing it), Confession (touch your mouth and then bring your hand away from your mouth to show a speaking action), Repentance (turn around from facing one way), Obedience (take a step in the new direction).\n  Has God’s Word ever convicted me of sin? Jesus calls me to confess, repent and obey. He is my help and He is ready to forgive me and give my strength by His Holy Spirit to follow Him!\n  __Thank you God for Your love and mercy that You show me in Jesus Christ. I want to follow You.__\n  I can ask Jesus for forgiveness and know that He forgives me. He hears my prayers (just as He heard Nehemiah’s prayers). I can ask God for inspiration and He will show me His plan and how I can participate in the work of His kingdom (just like Nehemiah was used by God to start rebuilding the walls). When I do what God wants, sometimes people (enemies) will be against me. I am not afraid because God is my help. Jesus gives me strength to continue to do what He has shown me to do.\n\n  timeline resource: http://biblehub.com/timeline/nehemiah/1.htm\n  http://biblehub.com/timeline/ezra/1.htm\n"}</script>

To Him who loves us and has set\n  us free from our sins by His blood, 6 and made us a kingdom, priests to His God\n  and Father—the glory and dominion are His forever and ever. Amen.”\nSummary: |\n  Ch. 1: The purpose and promise of the book, “The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave Him to show His slaves what must quickly take place. He sent it and signified it through His angel to His slave John, 2 who testified to God’s word and to the testimony about Jesus Christ, in all he saw. 3 The one who reads this is blessed, and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it are blessed, because the time is near!“ (1:1-3)\n  John saw a vision of Jesus. Jesus told him, “write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this.” (1:19).\n  Ch. 2 & 3:\n  In the letter to the church of Ephesus, Jesus said that they had correctly held on to the truth and endured for His name’s sake, but that they had left their first love. He said, “Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent,” and “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in God’s paradise.” (2:5 and 7).\n\n  In the letter to the church of Smyrna, Jesus told them to not fear that they would endure suffering for their faith. “Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer…Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. 11 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The victor will never be harmed by the second death“ (2:10-11).\n\n  In the letter to the church of Pergamum, Jesus said that they should repent of their sin. “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor some of the hidden manna.I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.“ (2:17).\n\n  In the letter to the church of Thyatira, Jesus said that, “I know your works—your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the first.“ (2:19). He wanted them to hold on to the truth until He came. “The one who is victorious and keeps My works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations—27 and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter; he will shatter them like pottery, just as I have received this from My Father. 28 I will also give him the morning star.“ (2:26-28).\n\n  In the letter to the church of Sardis, Jesus said that they are dead and should repent and wake up. “In the same way, the victor will be dressed in white clothes, and I will never erase his name from the book of life but will acknowledge his name before My Father and before His angels.6 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:5-6).\n\n  In the letter to the church of Philadelphia, Jesus said, “ I know your works. Because you have limited strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name, look, I have placed before you an open door that no one is able to close.“ (3:8). “The victor: I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God—the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God—and My new name. 13 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:12-13).\n\n  In the letter to the church of Laodicea, Jesus said that they were neither hot nor cold and that he would vomit them out of His mouth. He called them to come to Him and to repent: “ Listen! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and have dinner with him, and he with Me.” (3:20). “The victor: I will give him the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I also won the victory and sat down with My Father on His throne.22 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:21-22).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus Christ is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler\n  of the kings of the earth\n- He loved us and washed us from sin with His blood\n- God is Father\n- Jesus is coming with the clouds\n- He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End\n- He was and is and will come again\n- He is the Almighty\n- Jesus is the First and the Last, He was dead and lives forever and ever and holds\n  the keys of hell and death\n- Jesus examines the minds and hearts of all and will give to each one according to\n  their works (2:23)\n- He convicts and disciplines the ones that He loves\n- He warns and calls to repentance\n- He promises good things to those who overcome\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is coming. He is God and He is the Great King. He speaks to the churches and He speaks to me. He wants me to listen to Him and repent from any sinful behavior that is not pleasing to Him. His Holy Spirit and Word show me what to do. __Jesus, help me to be obedient. Thank you for Your wonderful promises.__\n  Jesus promises many good things to those who overcome. How can I overcome? 2 John 5:4 says, “because whatever has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith” __Jesus help me to trust You and live according to your Word and to walk in the Spirit. You are coming soon! Thank you that I can be with You forever in Your kingdom! While there is still time, help me to be your witness so that more people would come to know and love You. You are worthy!__\n"}</script>

Malachi: The spiritual and moral\n  reconstruction of the nation.'\nScripture: Neh. 8-13, Malachi\nTruth: God hears when we confess our sin\nVerse: Neh. 9:6 “You  alone are Yahweh. You created the heavens, the highest heavens\n  with all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in\n  them. You give life to all of them, and the heavenly host worships You.”\nSummary: |+\n  Ch. 8: Ezra read the Word and the leaders explained it to the people. The people cried when they heard God’s Word, but Ezra, Nehemiah, the priests and Levites told them to be glad. According to God’s Word, they celebrated and rejoiced, remembering the time when they lived in tents after God led them out of Egypt (Lev. 23:43).\n  Ch. 9-10: The people confessed their sin to God. The leaders said “Stand up. Praise Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting. Praise Your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.” (9:5). The people remembered their history and God’s faithfulness. They told God that they wanted to follow Him and keep His Word.\n  Ch. 11-12: The people decided who would live in Jerusalem and who would live around it. They sang and praised God because the walls were rebuilt.\n  Ch. 13: Nehemiah was in Babylon working for the king and when he returned to Jerusalem, he saw many problems. He corrected the people who had stopped serving God the right way and had allowed the enemy of God to live in the temple, and those who had married non Israelite women who didn’t worship God. Nehemiah wanted people to completely follow God and not repeat the mistake of their fathers who didn’t listen to God’s Word and went into captivity to Babylon.\n\n  Malachi: Malachi told the people that God loved them, but that they weren’t loving God. They were bringing not worshipping God with their whole hearts, the some of the leaders weren’t being honest, the some of the priests weren’t sharing God’s truth with the people and some of the  men were not being nice to their wives.  God reminded them that He is a great King and said that,“For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; In every place incense shall be offered to My name, And a pure offering; For My name shall be great among the nations,says the Lord of hosts.” (1:11)\n  Malachi shared God’s promises to send a messenger (John the Baptist) who would prepare the way for the Messiah (Jesus), who is also a messenger of the New Covenant (new relationship between God and people). The Messiah will be like fire and soap that cleans and refines people. He will judge people. God calls people to return to Him. He promises to bless them when they live for Him completely and trust Him with all they have.\n  Some people who feared (loved and respected) God made a book of remembrance and wanted to listen to and follow God. God called them His special treasure. God promised to come one day to judge the earth and to save those who love Him: ”But to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings” (Mal. 4:2). Again, God promised to send Elijah before He comes to judge the earth. In 3:1, the first coming of Jesus is described and in Ch. 4:1-3, the second coming of Jesus is described.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Holy\n- God is worthy of praise\n- God is a jealous God\n- God cleanses and corrects.God is Faithful\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He is King\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus heals sin and brokenness\n- Jesus saves those who fear HIm\n- He will judge those who don’t love Him\n- Jesus is coming again!\nApplication: |\n  Ezra read the Word to the people so that they would know God and praise Him. I want to read the Bible, so I can know God and praise Him. The people quickly started to live according to their old habits and walked away from God. God used Nehemiah and Malachi to warn them, so that they would return to Him. I want Jesus to warn and correct me through His Holy Spirit, the Word and believers so that I won’t start to walk away from God.\n  The people had allowed God’s enemy to live in the temple. Later, Nehemiah threw him out. Sometimes, I allow some kind of sin to be in my life and in my heart. Jesus wants to be the One and only master of my heart and He can throw out sin.__ Jesus, please cleanse me and help me to be completely given to You.__\n  Looking at prophecy can sometimes be like looking at mountains that are far away. At first, it seems like all the peaks are lined up together in the same place. In reality, some of the mountain peaks are closer to us and some are farther away. Malachi’s words were for the people that heard him speak, but they also are for us now. Some of these words already took place when God sent John the Baptist as the messenger to prepare the way for Jesus to come. Jesus says that John was like the Elijah that Malachi wrote about  but that Elijah will come again before God judges the earth (Malachi 4:5, Matt 17:11-13). These words are like 2 different mountain peaks. They look like they are in the same place, but they are for different times. Jesus came to bring us the New Covenant. By grace He saves us, through faith in Him. This last book of the Old Testament points to Jesus coming to save all people and bring the message of salvation and of judgement. Jesus saves all who trust in Him. He will judge all who do not trust in Him. Jesus is coming again!\n\n  *Malachi prophesied while Nehemiah was governor of Jerusalem.\n  Bible verses with explanation the chronology of Malachi can be found here:\n  http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/guzik_david/StudyGuide_Mal/Mal_1.cfm\n"}</script>

Everything glorifies God. Only Jesus is worthy to open the scroll with 7 seals because He overcame. He is the Lamb of God. In heaven, people from every tribe, language, people and nation will worship and praise God. Jesus made believers king and priests of God: they will reign on earth (5:10).\n\n  The 7 seals: In chapter 6, Jesus began to open the seals one by one and with each one, plagues happened on earth. John saw 144,000 sons of Israel that were sealed and many people from every tribe, language, people and nation. He saw those who died for their faith in Jesus who were in His presence and, “… the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them;He will guide them to springs of living waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.“ (7:17). When Jesus opened the 7th seal, there was 30 minutes of silence in heaven.\n\n  The 7 trumpets: The angels blew the trumpets and plagues started to happen on earth. Many people died from sores and those who didn’t still refused to repent from their sin (9:20). In Ch. 10, John saw a strong angel with an open book which God told John to eat in order to further prophesy to people. God said that His 2 witnesses would prophesy for 3 ½ years until the Beast kills them. But after 3 ½ days they will be resurrected and go up into heaven.\n  When the angel blows the 7th trumpet, “… there were loud voices in heaven saying: The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Messiah, and He will reign forever and ever!“ (11:15). People around the throne of God said, “The nations were angry, but Your wrath has come. The time has come for the dead to be judged and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth.“ (11:18).\n  John saw a vision of a woman and a dragon and a war in heaven that showed how satan warred against God and believers in Jesus and could not prevail. The Dragon (Satan) gave authority to the Beast whom non-believers worshiped. He ruled for 3 ½ years and killed believers in Jesus (13:7). “If anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed with a sword, with a sword he will be killed. This demands the perseverance and faith of the saints.“ (13:10). Another beast appeared who deceived people with miracles and told people to worship the first beast. He put a mark on people so that only those with the mark could buy and sell.\n\n  Ch. 14: John saw the Lamb (Jesus) on Mount Zion with the 144,000 sons of Israel. Then he saw, “…another angel flying high overhead, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. 7 He spoke with a loud voice: “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.“ (14:6-7). Another angel declared God’s victory and His punishment of non-believers. “This demands the perseverance of the saints, who keep God’s commands and their faith in Jesus.” 13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: The dead who die in the Lord from now on are blessed.” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “let them rest from their labors, for their works follow them!“ (14:12-13).\n  Then he saw how the angels in heaven began to harvest the earth with a sickle and throw grapes into the great winepress of God’s wrath. Those who overcame the beast sang to Jesus, “Great and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the Nations.4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, for all the nations will come and worship before You because Your righteous acts have been revealed.” (15:3-4).\nCharacter:\n- Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and it to come\n- 'The Lord is worthy to receive glory and honor and strength: for He has created\n  all things and because of His will they exist and were created'\n- He lives forever\n- Jesus is the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David and He conquered\n- Jesus redeemed people from every tribe, language, people and nation with His blood\n- He is the Lord who is Holy and True, who judges and avenges those who dwell on earth\n  for the blood of His saints the was shed (6:10)\n- Salvation belongs to God, who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb\n- God is Judge\n- Jesus is the Victor\n- He is the Lamb of God\nApplication: |\n  Jesus is worthy of worship. I worship Him alone. My prayers are like a pleasing fragrance before God (5:8). I believe that Jesus rules over all. Now I see those who don’t love Jesus and are doing evil. The Bible teaches me that Jesus will punish sin and destroy those who rebel on this fallen world. He wants me to trust Him and worship Him alone. Only He is worthy because He conquered sin and death on the cross and shed His blood to redeem me. Believers die for their faith in Jesus but a great reward awaits those who endure and remain faithful to Him. Jesus is always with me and He is my help.\n  Now there is time for non-believers to repent and come to Jesus. I don’t want unbelievers to experience the wrath of God. Believers receive salvation and not wrath as it says, “For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, “ (1 Thess. 5:9). __Jesus, help me to trust You, follow You and tell people about salvation in You. You are the Great Savior. You conquered. Thank you that you redeemed me and I belong to You and will be with You in Your eternal kingdom. All honor and glory to You forever.__\n"}</script>

I am thankful to Jesus that He came to save me. Only Jesus could fulfill all of these prophesies. I am confident that the Bible is the truth and that Jesus is the Only Savior.

Its rider\n  is called Faithful and True, and He judges and makes war in righteousness.”\nSummary: |\n  7 bowls of God’s wrath. A voice from the heavenly temple told the angels to pour out God’s wrath on the earth. The angels said that God is just and His judgement is righteous. People didn’t repent when God judged them (16:9 and 11). People on earth gathered at Armegeddon. When the angel poured out the 7th bowl on the earth, he said, “it is finished.” John said how God judged and conquered those who didn’t believe in Jesus. “They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful.“ (17:14). God brought an end to all the evil earthly kingdoms and judged them. “Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her (Babylon)!“ (18:20). In heaven, a great multitude of people said: “Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, 2  for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.“ (19:1-2). The people in heaven rejoiced that the time had come for the wedding feast of the Lamb.\n  John saw how Jesus came on a white horse. He is King, He is Faithful and True. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. He is the Word of God. Jesus judged and conquered all His enemies (including the Beast and the false prophet). An angel locked up the dragon (Satan) for 1,000 years in a bottomless pit so that he would not deceive people. Jesus reigned on earth for 1,000 years with the saints whom He resurrected. At the end of the 1,000 years, Satan was freed and deceived the nations. The nations warred against Jesus and wanted to win, but God saved His own and Satan was thrown into the lake of fire. John saw the Great White Throne and all the dead stood to be judged before God. If their name was not in the Lamb’s book of life, the person was thrown into the lake of fire. Death and hell were also thrown into the lake of fire.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Faithful and True\n- He judges rightly and wars\n- He is King of kings and Lord of lords\n- He is the Word of God\n- He is the Conqueror\n- He is Judge\nApplication: |\n  I believe that earthly kingdoms will come to an end, but the Heavenly Kingdom is eternal. I understand that God judges those who don’t believe in Jesus and they will be eternally punished. Jesus is coming and will conquer! Believers will rule with Him in His Kingdom. Now, it seems like Satan and evil people are winning but the Bible teaches me that they will lose. __Thank you Jesus that you have the victory! Thank you that my name is written in Your book of life because You have redeemed me and I belong to You. I want to be Your witness, so that people would know that You are King of kings and Lord of lords. Thank you for the living hope that I will be with You in Your glory forever. Help me to live in expectation of your return and tell people about salvation in You. __\n"}</script>

Scripture says that Jesus is King over all. It’s not important when someone lived (long ago or now), where they lived (in the jungle or in a muslim country), or who they were (rich or poor). Jesus is king over everyone. He is the One and Only Savior and King. People who don’t trust Him will be punished forever. People who trust Him will be rejoicing forever with Him! Do I believe that Jesus is King? Do I entrust my life to Jesus? Do I want to share with people about Jesus and about the hope that I have in Him? If I answer yes, I can ask for help from the Holy Spirit to know how to share with people. If I answer no, I can ask Jesus to give me love for Him and for others. If we want to love Him more, we can ask and He will help us!\n  When life is difficult here, I can remember the living hope that I have in Jesus. When I believe in Jesus, I have a place in His kingdom. I will be with Him where there are no tears, no pain and no sin! I can rejoice in the hope of heaven!\n"}</script>

He wrote, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful” (21:1-5).\n  They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.” (22:4-5) Jesus says several times that He is coming soon! Believers answer that they want Jesus to come and also want people to come to Jesus for the gift of new life. (22:17)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the King Eternal\n- Jesus is the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the First and the Last\n- Jesus is coming soon! Jesus is Savior\n- Jesus is the temple (the place of worship)\n- Jesus is the Lamb of God\n- Jesus is Conqueror\n- Jesus is the Righteous Judge\nApplication: |\n  God has a great plan of salvation. He wants people to be with Him. Without Jesus, everyone is separated from Him because of sin. But all can receive forgiveness through faith in Jesus. I and everyone that trusts in Jesus can be with God forever. This is good news! Do I believe in Jesus? Do I understand the salvation He offers? If I trust Him, then right now Jesus lives in my heart and His Holy Spirit is in me. But one day, Jesus will come and take me to be with Him.\n  He will make a new heaven and new earth. There, I will live with Jesus forever! In that place, there will be no sin, pain or suffering. There in heaven, also called the New Jerusalem, I will see Jesus face to face! I want everyone to be there with Jesus. That’s why I want to tell people about Him. Now, people can be saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in Him. But there will be a time when it will already be too late and Jesus will judge those who didn’t believe in Him and punish them in hell. Jesus gives rewards to those to believe in Him.__ Jesus, I don’t want people to go to hell. I want them to be with You in heaven. Save people, Jesus, and help me to tell people about salvation in You and about the hope of heaven, where You will reign. Help me to warn people about hell so they will quickly turn to the Saviour for mercy and forgiveness. Jesus, I am waiting for You! You are coming soon! I will be very glad to see You!
