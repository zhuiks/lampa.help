	Application
</h3>
		<p>God always keeps His promises. He made big promises to Abraham and Sarah and He kept them.  I can trust God. I believe that He saves me by His grace when I believe in Jesus. God provided Abraham with the ram for the sacrifice instead of Isaac just as He provided Jesus as the sacrifice for our sin instead of me being punished for my sin. I thank God that He gave us Jesus who died instead of me. I believe that Jesus‚Äô sacrifice paid for my sin. I believe that the righteousness of Jesus is necessary for my salvation.
		
	</p><p>Abraham trusted God with his son, who was precious to him. God wants us to trust Him with all that is important and valuable to us. Hebrews 11:17-19 says that Abraham was ready to sacrifice Isaac because he believed that God would raise him from the dead afterwards. I also believe that it‚Äôs good when I give to God whatever He asks me to give to Him. Somehow, He will bring life out of that sacrifice. Jesus died, but He rose again and now because of His death and resurrection, I have life in Him! God has provided eternal life to me, through faith in Jesus.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
