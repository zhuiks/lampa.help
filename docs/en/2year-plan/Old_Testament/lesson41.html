	Summary
</h3>
		<p>The Spirit of God was upon Elisha. Once there was a woman who asked Elisha to help her. Her husband had died and people wanted to take her sons as servants to pay off a debt. Elisha told her to find as many vessels as she could. She found a lot. Then the prophet told her to pour oil into the vessels. The oil miraculously didn‚Äôt run out until the last vessel was filled. Then the widow sold the oil to pay off the debt.</p><p>Elisha came to a city where a certain family took care of him. He prayed that God would give them a child. After several years, the child got sick and died. His mother travelled to Elisha but she didn‚Äôt tell him that her son died. Elisha quickly went to the boy and prayed that God would bring him back to life. He prayed several times and God brought the boy back to life. God raised him from the dead.</p><p>Elisha was with some other prophets and their food was bad. He put flour in the food and after that they could eat it. Someone brought 20 loaves of bread to the 100 prophets. But God did a miracle and when they ate, there was enough for everyone. They were full and there was even bread left over.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Before Elijah was taken up to God, Elisha asked for God‚Äôs Spirit to be upon him (2 Kings 2:9). God answered his prayer and did many miracles through Elisha. Through these miracles, God blessed and cared for people in amazing ways. God can use ordinary things (flour and oil) and ordinary people (Elisha, you and me) for His glory, so that people would see that He is great! Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to believers to help them love God and tell others about Him. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit and to be glorified in my life (Lk.11:13).
		
	</p><p>God raised the boy from the dead. This reminds me of Jesus. Jesus brings life from death. He rose from the dead and He gives life to those who are dead in sin and promises to raise believers from the dead (Rom.8:11). That is a great miracle! He showed His great love for us when He died for us, so that we can have life in Him.  There are many people around me who are spiritually dead. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to tell them about the life that you can give them!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
