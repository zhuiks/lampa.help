Then they rebuilt the foundation of the temple in Jerusalem so that they could worship God there again.

The prophets Haggai and Zechariah spoke God‚Äôs Word to the people that they should continue rebuilding the temple. ‚ÄúNot by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,‚ÄôSays the Lord of hosts.‚Äù (Zechariah 4:6) The people wrote a letter to the new king, Darius and asked for his permission. God gave a command through Darius and he told them that they could continue the work.

For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.‚Äù (Ezra 7:9-10). The king gave Ezra a special letter promising him help for teaching people to worship God. Many people decided to go back to Jerusalem with Ezra.

He tore his clothes, pulled some hair from his beard, sat down in shock and didn‚Äôt eat until evening time. He prayed to God, admitting that the people were guilty. He reminded the people that God had sent them into exile and that in His mercy had brought them back to the land. Many people gathered around Ezra and started crying and confessing their sin (Ezra 10:1-2). They decided to promise to follow God and not to have the wives that didn‚Äôt love God.  They gathered together on a very rainy day and decided to follow God.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God promised to bring the people back to the land. I know that when God promises something, He will fulfill His Word. The Bible is God‚Äôs Word and it is true. Jesus helps me to fulfill God‚Äôs Word just as God helped the people to rebuild the temple when He commanded them to do so. Sometimes, people stand in the way of God‚Äôs work but nothing can stop God.
		
	</p><p>Ezra was sad when he heard that people were not following God‚Äôs Word (when they married women who didn‚Äôt love God). The people were convicted of sin (realized that they were guilty), they confessed it (admitted their sin to God), they repented and obeyed God‚Äôs Word (followed God).
		
	</p><p>*Idea for teaching: use gestures to teach the key words: convicted, confession, repentance and obedience. Convicted (strike your heart with your finger, like an arrow is piercing it), Confession (touch your mouth and then bring your hand away from your mouth to show a speaking action), Repentance (turn around from facing one way), Obedience (take a step in the new direction).
		
	</p><p>Has God‚Äôs Word ever convicted me of sin? Jesus calls me to confess, repent and obey. He is my help and He is ready to forgive me and give my strength by His Holy Spirit to follow Him!
		
	</p><p>__ Thank you God for Your love and mercy that You show me in Jesus Christ. I want to follow You.__

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
