		<p>There was famine in Israel and Naomi and her family moved to the land of Moab, where people did not worship God. Her sons married girls there who were not Israelites.  Naomi‚Äôs husband and sons died. Naomi returned to the land of Israel and one of her daughter- in-laws‚Äô, Ruth, believed in God and wanted to stay with Naomi, to help her.</p><p>Ruth went to work in a field gathering grain. She was a hard worker. The owner of the field, Boaz, met her and gave her food. He said that she should work at his field where it was safe. Naomi knew the law about redemption in Israel. According to this law, a close relative could marry Ruth and then take care of her and Naomi. Boaz was a close relative. Naomi told Ruth to go remind Boaz that he was a close relative. Boaz loved God and wanted to help but he waited to see if the other close relative wanted to do fulfill the redemption law and buy Naomi‚Äôs land and marry Ruth. But that relative didn‚Äôt want to marry Ruth. Then Boaz was happy to marry Ruth and God gave them a child. Naomi thanked God. Thier son became the grandfather of David.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Boaz is a picture (someone who shows us something) of Jesus. Boaz paid a price to redeem Naomi‚Äôs land and to marry Ruth. Jesus paid a price when He died for me on the cross to redeem me from my sin and make me His own. He is my saviour who loves me and cares about me. I can come to Jesus for help. I am glad that He never leaves me or forsakes me.
		
	</p><p>Ruth is a picture of the nations (non Israelites) who are a part of the Church. Israel is God‚Äôs special people and He showed His plan of salvation through them. He wants all people on earth to know about Him through the Israelites. Ruth, a Gentile (from the nations) came to know God and she was redeemed. Jesus is the Redeemer of people from all nations who trust Him for salvation. Through faith, Ruth became a part of God‚Äôs plan. Through faith in Jesus, I too am a part of God‚Äôs plan. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, use my life so that many people will come to know you, that you are Redeemer.</em>
	</p><p>God fulfilled His plan to give Israel the promised Redeemer through the family of Ruth and Boaz. Their great grandson David (about whom we will learn soon) became king and God promised him that the Messiah would come through David‚Äôs family. After many years, Jesus fulfilled this promise and came from the family of David. He is our King and Redeemer.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
