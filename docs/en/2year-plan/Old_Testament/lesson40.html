	Summary
</h3>
		<p>1 Kings 19: When Jezebel, the wife of king Ahab heard that the prophets of Baal had been killed, she was angry with Elijah and sent him a message that she wanted to kill him. Elijah got scared and ran away to the south. He wanted to give up and die but God sent an angel who fed him and strengthened him to walk 40 days and 40 nights to Mount Horeb. He found a cave and there heard God‚Äôs voice asking him ‚Äúwhat are you doing here, Elijah?‚Äù He told God that he was the only believer and that he was scared for his life. God showed him a mighty wind, earthquake and fire but the Lord was not in those things. Then there was a soft whisper. God again spoke to Elijah and asked ‚Äúwhat are you doing here, Elijah?‚Äù Elijah answered the same as before. God sent Elijah north to anoint kings in Syria and Israel. He also wanted Elijah to anoint Elisha to be prophet in his place. God also told him that he wasn‚Äôt alone but that there were still 7,ooo people in Israel who had not worshipped the false god, Baal. Elijah found Elisha. Elisha left his old life to fulfill God‚Äôs calling.</p><p></p><p>2 Kings 2: God was going to take Elijah to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah travelled to different cities and wanted to leave Elisha but Elisha wanted to stay with him. Many of God‚Äôs prophets said goodbye to Elijah, knowing that God would take him to Himself. Elijah and Elisha miraculously crossed the Jordan river. Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him before he left. He said that he wanted a double portion of his spirit. Elijah answered that if he saw him when he was taken, that it would be so. As they were walking together suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and God took Elijah up in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it and cried out ‚Äúmy father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel‚Äù Then Elisha crossed over the river in a miraculous way again and the other prophets saw that the spirit of God was upon Elisha. They searched for Elijah for three days even though Elisha said that it was useless.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>When people are against me because of my faith in Jesus, I can ask for help and boldness from God to not run away (like Elijah did). I can know that God is with me wherever I go. God will take care of me. God has a plan for me and for His glory. God shows me his plan through His Word. I want to participate in God‚Äôs plan and obey Him. Elisha followed Elijah and left his old life behind. I want to completely follow Jesus. When I believe in Jesus, His Holy Spirit lives in me. When I believe in Jesus, I know that He will take me to be with Him in heaven.
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Scriptures for further discussion about God taking us to be with Him and being with Jesus in heaven:
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>1 Thess. 4:13-18‚Äù But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.‚Äù
		
	</p><p>Rev 22:4 ‚ÄùThey shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads‚Äù
		
	</p><p>Job 19:25-27 ‚ÄùFor I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; 26 and  after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God, 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!‚Äù

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
