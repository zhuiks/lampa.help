	Summary
</h3>
		<p>In Gen. 28:10-22 through Gen. 30:24, Jacob leaves his family because he is afraid that his brother will hurt him. He goes to his mom‚Äôs relatives who live far away. On the way there, God speaks to Jacob, showing him a ladder going from heaven to earth and promises to give Jacob the land that He promised to Abraham and to be with Jacob. Jacob goes to live with his uncle Laban, who tricks Jacob into marrying his older daughter instead of the younger daughter that he promised him. Jacob marries the younger daughter too. He takes 2 more wives. God gives Jacob many children.</p><p>Gen 31-33: Jacob and his family leave Laban without saying goodbye. Laban was angry and ran after Jacob but God protected Jacob. Jacob was going back to the land where his parents were and was afraid to see his brother, Esau. At night, an angel wrestled with Jacob.  God gave him a new name and touched his hip so that it would be weak. Jacob and Esau met and they hugged each other. Jacob and his family found a place to live and Jacob built an altar to worship God.</p><p>See also: Hosea 12:3-4 ‚ÄúHe took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he struggled with God.Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him in Bethel, and there He spoke to us.‚Äù</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God is with me. God fulfills His promises to me. What promises are in the Bible? In Jesus, He promises to love me, forgive my sin, bring me to heaven to live with him, give me the Holy Spirit for wisdom, help, strength and comfort. I trust Jesus. When I am afraid, I can ask Jesus for help and He helps me just like He helped Jacob when he was afraid of meeting his brother.
		
	</p><p>Jacob wrestled with God and He gave him a new name and touched his hip so that Jacob would never forget that God is stronger. God didn‚Äôt want Jacob to try to do things in his own strength.  Jacob started to trust God.  I can ask God for help. I don‚Äôt want to try to do things in my own strength. I don‚Äôt have enough strength; God always has enough strength!
		
	</p><p>God wants a husband to have only one wife (Gen 2:24). Jacob had many wives and because of that there was jealousy and envy in the family. This was not pleasing to God. God gave Jacob many children. This was part of the fulfillment of God‚Äôs promise to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18) and Isaac (Gen. 26:4).

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
