	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>Nehemiah asked God to forgive him and his people. I can ask Jesus for forgiveness and know that He hears my prayers and forgives me. He hears my prayers. God used Nehemiah to lead people in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem.  I can ask for inspiration from God and He will show me His plan so I can participate in His work for His kingdom. When I do what God wants and people (enemies) are against me, I won‚Äôt be afraid because God is my help. Perhaps something in my heart or my life seems broken down like the walls of Jerusalem. Jesus can restore and heal the brokenness in my life and in my heart. Jesus, I trust you to restore and heal me. I trust You to give me strength to continue to do what You have shown me to do. Remind me that you fight for me! You died on the cross to fight against sin and death and the devil and you won! You are my help and I praise You!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
