		<p>Jonah 1: God told Jonah to go to Nineveh (an enemy city of Israel) and warn the people about God‚Äôs punishment. Jonah got on a boat going the opposite direction. God sent a storm on the sea. The sailors found out that the storm was because of Jonah‚Äôs disobedience to God. He told them that he believed in the Lord God who made the heavens, the sea and the land. They were afraid of God‚Äôs wrath and did what Jonah said then he told them to throw him into the sea. Then the sea was calm and the sailors worshipped God.</p><p>Jonah 2 God told a big fish (whale) to swallow Jonah and he was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights. Jonah prayed to God and said that ‚ÄúSalvation is from the Lord.‚Äù The Lord told the whale to spit Jonah out on land.</p><p>Jonah 3: The Lord told Jonah a second time to go to Nineveh to speak His Word there. Jonah decided to listen and told the people of the city that in 40 days, God would destroy their city. The people listened, believed God‚Äôs Word and repented. The king told people to fast and to turn from their evil ways and ask God for mercy. God saw what they did, when they turned from their evil ways and He decided to show them mercy.</p><p>Jonah 4: But Jonah was upset and annoyed by this. He didn‚Äôt want God to show them mercy. Jonah sat overlooking the city. God made a plant grow over his head to give him shade from the sun and Jonah was glad. But later, God sent a wind to dry up the plant. Jonah was upset and wanted to die. God showed him that it wasn‚Äôt right that Jonah felt bad about the plant and didn‚Äôt feel bad for the people of Nineveh who didn‚Äôt understand right from wrong.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God was merciful to the Ninevites and to Jonah. I can‚Äôt run away from God like Jonah wanted to. It‚Äôs dangerous to be disobedient to God. God forgives me and saves me when I call out to Him. I know that Jesus wants to save all people, even people who seem to be my enemies. God wants people to turn to Jesus.  Jonah wasn‚Äôt glad, but I can be glad about God‚Äôs plan to save people. Maybe God wants me to tell my enemies about salvation in Jesus. Help me to remember that I don‚Äôt deserve your kindness, no one does, but that‚Äôs why the gospel is such good news!  Jesus, please  give me a compassionate heart for unbelievers and help me to share Your love and mercy with them and to warn them of God‚Äôs wrath.
		
	</p><p>Jesus spoke about Jonah and said ‚ÄúFor as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.‚Äù Luke 11:30.  and ‚ÄúFor as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.‚Äù Matt. 12:40. Jonah is a picture of Christ Jesus.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
