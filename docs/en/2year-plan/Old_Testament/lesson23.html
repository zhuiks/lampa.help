	Application
</h3>
		<p>God gave His people special rules to live holy, separate, different and clean. They were suppose to be different from the other people around them. But these laws didn‚Äôt change the hearts of the people. Only Jesus can make me clean and holy. Only Jesus can help me to love God and to live pleasing to God. He gives me a new heart to love Him and His ways. He gives me His Holy Spirit so that I can live differently from the world (not selfish) and for God (that I would be like Jesus).
		
	</p><p>God led the Israelites every day. He will show me where to go and what to do when I ask Him to lead me. God leads me day and night and will never leave me. Jesus is always with me and He leads my life. The Bible shows me God‚Äôs way. The Holy Spirit helps me  to follow Jesus.
		
	</p><p>Extra explanation about the sacrifices: When the people of Israel sinned (didn‚Äôt love God) through their actions and words, God wanted them to bring different sacrifices to the tabernacle. When they did something their own way and not God‚Äôs way, they were suppose to bring a sacrifice because the blood covered their sin. Sin (when we don‚Äôt love God) leads to death. The blood of the animal sacrifice was in place of the blood of the person who sinned. When they saw the blood of the animal, the remembered that their sin led to death and that they need forgiveness for their sins from God. But the blood of animals can‚Äôt make a person‚Äôs heart clean. Only Jesus can. He shed His blood for my sin on the cross and now through faith in Him and His perfect sacrifice, He forgives my sins and gives me  a new heart!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
