		<p></p><p>2 Kings 17: the king of Assyria took over the land of Israel and make the people move to a far away land. God allowed this because they didn‚Äôt listen to Him and worshipped idols. God sent them prophets but they didn‚Äôt listen to them. They didn‚Äôt want to follow God‚Äôs Word.</p><p>2 Kings 25: The Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem and destroyed the temple and the beautiful houses. He led the people away to captivity in Babylon.</p><p>Jeremiah 25:11-12: God told the people that they would be in captivity for 70 years and then God would punish Babylon.</p><p>Isaiah 44: God said that it‚Äôs foolish to worship idols that are made by people. He also promised to return the people to their land.</p><p>Daniel 1: Nebuchadnezzar took many people away from Judah when he conquered it. Daniel and his friends were some of those people. King Nebuchadnezzar had a special plan for Daniel and his friends. He wanted them to serve in his kingdom and wanted them to study the ways for Babylon for three years. He also gave them food from his table. But Daniel and his friends couldn‚Äôt eat the king‚Äôs food because it wasn‚Äôt clean according to God‚Äôs law. God gave them favor with the person in charge of them when Daniel asked to only eat vegetables and drink water. He decided to test them for 10 days and the Babylonians saw that Daniel and his friends looked better than those who were eating the king‚Äôs food. Daniel and his friends continued to study and God gave them wisdom and knowledge. At the end of the three years, the king tested them and saw that Daniel and his friends were the best.</p><p>King Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream. He wanted to know what it meant. He wanted his wise men to tell him his dream and if they couldn‚Äôt, he would kill all of the wise men. Daniel and his friends prayed to God for help. God told Daniel the the king‚Äôs dream and it‚Äôs meaning. In the dream there was a big statue made of different metals. In the end, a big rock destroyed the statue and became big mountain that filled the earth. Daniel explained that the different metals were different kingdoms. The big Rock was God‚Äôs eternal kingdom that would destroy all the other ones and rule forever. Nebuchadnezzar said that Daniel‚Äôs God was the best and rewarded Daniel and his friends with good jobs serving him.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The people in Israel and Judah lived their own way. They worshipped idols and did evil things.  God sent many prophets to warn the people and ask them to return to loving Him alone. He punished them by sending them into exile. This showed them that life without God is painful. But God promised to bring His people back to their land. He took care of His people that loved and trusted Him.
		
	</p><p>Daniel and his friends trusted God and did what was pleasing to Him. They loved God and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt want to eat the king‚Äôs food.  Jesus, help me to follow You even when ‚Äúimportant‚Äù people are telling me to do something else. People saw that following God was good. Jesus is glorified (seen as great) in my life when I love and follow Him.
		
	</p><p>Daniel knew that God knows everything and that He rules over everything and controls everything. He knew that God could tell him the king‚Äôs dream. The king then understood that God is the greatest. When I follow Jesus and look to Him for help, others see that He is great. Jesus is the big rock in the king‚Äôs dream that will get rid of all the other kingdoms and rule forever. He is big and strong and He rules over everything and everyone
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">. Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because Your kingdom is forever.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
