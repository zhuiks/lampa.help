	Summary
</h3>
		<p>After Jesus fed the crowd of people, He sent His disciples over to the other side of the sea in their boats while He went to the mountain to pray. There was a strong wind on the sea and the disciples couldn‚Äôt row to shore. It was around 3am and Jesus came to them walking on the water. They thought that it was a ghost and were scared. Jesus said ‚Äúit is I, do not be afraid!‚Äù ‚ÄúThen He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled.  For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.‚Äù (Mark 6:51-52)</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Many of the disciples were experienced fishermen and perhaps they thought that it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to row across the sea in their own strength. But without Jesus‚Äô help, they couldn‚Äôt get to shore. I also can‚Äôt do anything without Jesus. Without Jesus everything will be hard and it seems like the wind is blowing against me. The disciples didn‚Äôt understand that they needed to give everything into Jesus‚Äô hands (just as they gave the bread and the fish to Him and Jesus multiplied it). I also sometimes think that I can do something without Jesus‚Äô help. This is a mistake. Jesus has authority over everything. He can walk on water. He can stop the wind. Jesus wanted the disciples to understand that they need Him. When Jesus appeared, they were afraid, but He told them to be encouraged (be of good cheer) and to not be afraid. He was with them! Once He was in the boat, the wind stopped.  
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, teach me to turn to you for help and receive strength and wisdom from You. I am encouraged that You have control over everything. You tell me not to fear. You are with me. Thank you, Jesus!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
