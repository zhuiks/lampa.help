		<p>Seven of Jesus‚Äô disciples went fishing. Jesus stood on the shore and asked if they had caught any fish. They answered that they hadn‚Äôt caught any. He told them to throw their net on the other side and when they did, they suddenly caught a great number of fish. John recognized Jesus on the shore. Peter jumped out of the boat and swam to Jesus.

Jesus asked him ‚Äú‚Ä¶ do you love Me more than these?‚Äù He said to Him, ‚ÄúYes, Lord; You know that I love You.‚Äù He said to him, ‚ÄúFeed My lambs.‚Äù Jesus asked Peter two more times and the last time, Peter answered ‚ÄúLord!

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus knew where His disciples would be and what they were doing. He met them and helped them miraculously. The miracle with the fish is just like the miracle at the beginning of Jesus‚Äô ministry on earth. He cared for the disciples and prepared breakfast for them. Jesus always knows where I am and what I am doing. He knows my needs. He is my help. He cares for me.
		
	</p><p>Earlier, when Peter was scared, he said three times that he didn‚Äôt know Jesus. He was sad and Jesus knew that. Jesus talked separately with Peter and asked Peter three times if he loved Him. Jesus reconciled Peter to Himself. Peter had the opportunity to tell Jesus that He loved Him and understand that Jesus forgave his sin. When I sin, I am not loving Jesus. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please forgive me of my sin and help me love You more than anything or anyone else.</em>
	</p><p>Jesus wanted Peter to care for others when He said to him ‚Äúfeed my lambs.‚Äù Jesus gives me love for Him and others. Jesus, please show me how to love those around me. There are many people who don‚Äôt know about Jesus‚Äô love and care. I can tell them how they can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit who strengthens me and pours out God‚Äôs love in my heart so I can share about Jesus (Rom 5:5).

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
