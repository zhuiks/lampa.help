	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Once, on a Sabbath day, Jesus’ disciples picked heads of grain and ate them. The Pharisees saw them and scolded them, calling what they did “work” and “labor” and saying that they weren’t suppose to do that on the sabbath. Jesus answered by reminding them of the time when David came to the tabernacle and ate bread that usually only the priests are allowed to eat. The priest allowed David to eat that bread. Jesus said “But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”” (Matt 12:7-8). Jesus also explained that the priests work on the Sabbath when they serve in the temple, but their service is pleasing to God. Jesus said, “the sabbath is made for man and not the man for the sabbath….” (Mark 2:27-28).</p><p>A week later, on the next Sabbath, Jesus was in the synagogue (the place where people gathered to read God’s Word and a man with a withered hand was there. The Pharisees wanted to see if Jesus would heal the man on the Sabbath. Jesus knew their thoughts. He asked “what is right to do on the Sabbath? good or evil? to save a soul or destroy it? but they were silent.” (Lk. 6:9).  Jesus healed the man’s hand but the Pharisees were angry.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus always does good. The day, time or circumstances don’t limit Him. Jesus always loves me and helps me. In the law, there was one day when people weren’t suppose to work. This special day is a picture for me to understand that God gives me rest. I can’t work for my salvation or try to gain more of God’s love through what I do. No! My salvation is a gift of grace from Jesus. Jesus and only Jesus is perfect and never sinned. He died and rose again and now invites me to live in His rest every day and not only on the Sabbath. Hebrews 4:9-10 says, “…..”
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.” </em>
	</p><p>The Pharisees believed that their rules and traditions were more important than God’s love. They didn’t receive God’s grace (undeserved kindness and help). They thought that they needed to be good for God to accept them. But no one is good enough for the Holy God to accept them. That’s why Jesus came from heaven to earth! He is good and always does good. I trust in His goodness and righteousness. He gives me His Holy Spirit to live God’s way. He changes my heart. Do I sometimes think that I can keep the rules by myself and that I’m good? 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to not be fooled. Only You change my heart and help me to love you and others in all I think, say and do. I rest in You Jesus because you did all the work of the law for me. You are the Lord of the Sabbath, the Lord of my Rest.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету.

Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
