		<p>Jesus‚Äô disciples saw a blind man and wanted to know why he was blind, and asked who sinned, the man or his parents. Jesus said that their sin wasn‚Äôt the reason that he was blind, but that God wanted to be glorified through his healing. Jesus healed the man and he could see! The Pharisees wanted to know who healed him because it was the sabbath (their day of rest) and they thought that is was wrong to heal on their day of rest. The man said that Jesus healed him and that he believed that Jesus was from God because He did the miracle and helped him. The parents of the healed man were afraid of what the Pharisees thought. The Pharisees wanted to kick out everyone who believed in Jesus but the healed man said that he believed that Jesus was from God and so the Pharisees kicked him out (of the synagogue). Jesus found the man and explained to him that He is the Messiah. The healed man believed and worshipped Jesus. Jesus said that He came to the world so that people who don‚Äôt know about Him would see that He is the Messiah. But those who think that they already know everything and don‚Äôt believe in Jesus would not see that Jesus is the Messiah. They are spiritually blind. The Pharisees were offended by Jesus‚Äô words.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>People who don‚Äôt believe that Jesus is Saviour are spiritually blind. That means that they don‚Äôt see who Jesus really is and they can‚Äôt have forgiveness from sins. Do I believe that Jesus died and rose again and that only His righteousness can pay for my sin and cleanse me from sin? When I believe in Jesus and trust Him, He makes me see Him correctly and I can be a part of God‚Äôs family. The healed man was thankful to Jesus and knew that Jesus is Saviour. Even when his parents were afraid to say the truth, he still confessed his faith in Jesus. I also can tell people that I believe in Jesus even when they don‚Äôt accept me because of it and even when my parents don‚Äôt support the truth. I can expect that some people will not accept me because of my faith in Jesus. But Jesus is always with me. I know that He is Saviour. The opinion of God is more important than the opinion of people. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, give me strength to believe You and tell people the truth that I love you and that you are my Saviour.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
