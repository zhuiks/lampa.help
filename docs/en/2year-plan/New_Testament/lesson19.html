	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus died and rose again in order to redeem me. He looks at His church (a group of believers) as a treasure. He gave His life to make me His own, so that I would belong to Him. Do I believe that Jesus paid a high price to make me His own? I am very thankful to Jesus that He redeemed me. It was Jesus‚Äô joy to do this, as it says in Hebrews 12:2 ‚Äúlooking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.‚Äù See also Luke 19:10 ‚Äúfor the Son of Man came to seek and save the lost.‚Äù When I understand how I am a sinner, how I was lost and how Jesus is Holy, I am amazed that He sought me out to save me and make me His special treasure. This makes me treasure Him! 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, you are most valuable to me, like a treasure! Teach me more about Yourself, and grow my love for you, so that I would treasure you more!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
