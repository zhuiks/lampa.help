		<p>The church in Antioch was praying, fasting and worshipping God when the Holy Spirit said, ‚ÄúNow separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them ‚Äú (Acts 13:2). They sent them off and they travelled and shared with people about Jesus. They went to Cyprus and shared about Jesus on the whole island. There was a false prophet there, who was against the Good News. God blinded him for a time; people saw the miracle and believed in Jesus and the Word. Then they sailed to Pamphylia and shared in the synagogue (where the Jews read the Old Testament) and Paul preached Jesus and explained that the Old Testament talks about Jesus. Some of the Jews believed and even the Gentiles believed, ‚ÄúAnd the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region‚Äú (Acts 13:49). Then some unbelieving Jews drove Paul and Barnabas away. They continued on their way, ‚ÄúAnd the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit‚Äú (Acts 13:52).</p><p>In Iconium, they also shared in the synagogue and many Jews and Gentiles believed. The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles wanted to stone them but they left and went to Lycaonia. In the city of Lystra, Paul healed a crippled man in the name of Jesus. People thought that Paul and Barnabas were gods and wanted to sacrifice to them. But Paul explained that there is only one God who made heaven and earth and that they should worship Him. Then the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles stoned Paul. The believers prayed for him and he got up and continued on his way. In every place they prayed and fasted that God would show them who should be leaders there. They later returned to the church in Antioch, where they started from, ‚ÄúNow when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles‚Äù (Acts 14:27).</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The believers in Antioch prayed and worshipped God. The Holy Spirit spoke to them and told them what to do, so they prayed for Paul and Barnabas and sent them off to fulfill God‚Äôs calling. I also can pray with believers and hear from the Holy Spirit. Today also, God sends people from the church to share about Jesus with people who still haven‚Äôt heard about Him. I want to be obedient to the Holy Spirit and share with people about Jesus in my homeland and beyond it‚Äôs borders and even to the ends of the earth. I want to support (in prayer etc.) those whom God sends out for missions from my church.
		
	</p><p>When Paul and Barnabas shared about Jesus, some people believed in Him and others didn‚Äôt. Some became a part of the church (a group of believers in Jesus) and others wanted to stop them and kick them out. There will always be different reactions (responses) towards Jesus. I know that Jesus wants to save everyone but not everyone will love Jesus. People who don‚Äôt love Jesus also won‚Äôt love me. It‚Äôs important that I know: Jesus loves me and loves them. That‚Äôs why I want to tell people about Him. People without Jesus will perish (die without hope) but God doesn‚Äôt want people to perish. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to share about You. Give me boldness to share even when people don‚Äôt receive You. Thank you that You are always with me even when it‚Äôs scary and people want to kick me out because of my faith in You. Use my life, so that many people would know You, Jesus!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
