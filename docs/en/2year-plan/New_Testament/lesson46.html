	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul and Barnabas were in an area called Galatia (Acts 14). They heard that some of the believing Jews told the believing Gentiles that they should keep the whole law if they wanted to be real believers in Jesus (Gal 1:6). Paul wrote a letter to the believers in Galatia so they would remember that all people are saved by Jesus‚Äô grace through faith in His righteousness and not by keeping the law (which is impossible). Only Jesus (who is God and man) fulfilled the whole law (Rom. 8:3-4). Paul wrote, ‚Äúknowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified‚Äù (Gal 2:16). Believers understand that Jesus fulfilled the whole law and gives them new life. ‚ÄúFor I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. ‚Äú (Gal. 2:19-20).</p><p>In Gal. 5, Paul writes that believers should walk in the Spirit (that is, follow Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit). ‚ÄúBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.‚Äù (Gal. 5:22-23) When a person belongs to Jesus (through faith in Him), he won‚Äôt live according to his selfish desires but will live by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit (Gal. 5:24). In Gal. 6, he writes that believers don‚Äôt boast in their deeds or in how they fulfill the law which doesn‚Äôt save them. They boast in Christ Jesus and in what He accomplished on the cross (Gal. 6:14).</p><p>In Jerusalem, there was a church council where they discussed the question of salvation for the Gentiles (Acts 15). They all agreed that Jesus saves everyone by grace and that the law doesn‚Äôt save. That‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt right to teach people to fulfill the law for salvation. They wrote the Gentile believers a letter where they explained this. Then Paul and Silas returned to Galatia to see the believers and tell them that truly, they are all saved through faith in Jesus Christ and not through works of the law. (Acts 16:1-6).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus saves me and everyone who believes in Him by grace. Trying to fulfill the law doesn‚Äôt save me. I am wrong if I think that God will accept me if I do good works. God accepts those who put their faith in the perfect life, sacrifice and victory of Jesus. I trust in the righteousness of Jesus and not my ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù. When I believe in Him, by grace, He forgives my sin and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit, who lives in me and helps me to live pleasing to God. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. When I love Jesus (and He helps me to love Him), then just like an apple tree that grows apples, so my life and my heart will be filled with love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. I can ask Jesus to grow the fruit of the Holy Spirit in my life and that I would love Him and others more and more.
		
	</p><p>What does the fruit of the Holy Spirit look like? What do these look like:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? What examples of each one can I think of? Jesus is God and He showed us all of the fruit of the Spirit. Which examples from the life of Jesus can I remember that are examples of:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please grow the fruit of the Spirit in my life.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
