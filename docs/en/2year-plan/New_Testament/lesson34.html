		<p>The soldiers and people brought Jesus to judgement to the religious leaders and then to the Roman governor, Pilate.

Pilate knew that Jesus wasn’t guilty but he was afraid of what people thought and gave the order to crucify Jesus. During the time of judgement, Peter denied Jesus three times, just as Jesus had said he would. Peter cried. Pilate sent Jesus to Herod. The soldiers were very rude to Jesus and beat Him and laughed at Him. Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. He wanted to release Jesus but the people asked for a criminal to be released instead. They shouted “crucify Him!” and so Pilate agreed to crucify Jesus.</p><p>Jesus hung on the cross between two thieves. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised that he would be with Him in paradise. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the veil in the temple tore from the top to bottom. Jesus said “It is finished!” (Jn 19:30). He died.</p><p>The disciples saw where Jesus’ body was buried in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it.</p><p>On the third day, just as He said, Jesus rose again! He is alive! The women came to anoint His body but they saw angels that told them that He had risen. The disciples later ran to the grave and saw that He wasn’t there but they didn’t understand that He was alive.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus loves us! He gave His life for us. It was His choice to give His life. I know that Jesus died for my sins and rose again. Only He lived a sinless life and only He can forgive my sin and cleanse me. By faith, He imputes His righteousness to me (attributes His righteousness to me). I trust His Righteousness and know that only by faith in Him, I am saved. I am not saved by good works or good behavior. Jesus saves me by His grace. I want to tell everyone about my Saviour, Jesus! He loves us and wants to give us a heart that loves God and others. He promises to receive me in heaven so that I can be with Him forever! This is GOOD NEWS that everyone needs to hear!

	</p><p>see also Rom 6:5-11: “For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.  For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

	</p><p>*note: between the gospel accounts, there are many details surrounding Jesus’ trial, crucifixion and resurrection. Depending upon the attention span of your group, you may want to omit some details to focus on the big picture. (example: omit details about Herod, Pilate washing his hands, Simon the Cyrenian carrying the cross, Jesus put in the tomb of a rich man  etc)

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
