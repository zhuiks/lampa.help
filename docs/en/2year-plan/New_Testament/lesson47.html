	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul and Silas travelled to Macedonia and were in the city, Philippi (Acts 16:12). There, a lady named Lydia and her family believed in Jesus (Acts 16:14-15). They all gathered at the river to pray (Acts 16:13). Once, on the way there, they met a demon-possessed servant girl. Her master used her to make money (the demon in her would guess people‚Äôs future). The girl followed Paul and the others saying ‚ÄúThese men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation‚Äù (Acts 16:17).  After hearing this for many days, Paul drove the demon out of her in the name of Jesus Christ. The master of the girl was angry because he couldn‚Äôt make money with her any more and complained to the leaders of the city about Paul and Silas. They beat them and put them in prison.</p><p>At night, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praise songs to God and all the prisoners heard them. Then there was an earthquake and the doors of the prison opened. The jailer wanted to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had run away, but Paul stopped him. The jailer wanted to know how to be saved. Paul and Silas said ‚ÄúBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.‚Äù (Acts 16:31) The jailer led them out and his whole house heard the Word of the Lord. The jailer washed Paul and Silas‚Äôs wounds and his household believed in Jesus and was baptized. Then they ate. In the morning, the city leaders released Paul and Silas from prison. Paul said that they put them in prison unjustly and asked that the leaders come themselves to lead them out of prison. Then Paul and Silas went to Lydia‚Äôs house, to the believers in Jesus.</p><p></p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>Paul, Silas and the others travelled to tell people about Jesus. I also can look for people who don‚Äôt know about Jesus, to tell them about His love and salvation. Where can I share about Jesus? I can share in school, at home, on the street, at the playground and even in other countries. Paul and the others met a demon possessed servant girl. In the name of Jesus, she was freed from the demon. Only Jesus can free a person. He is God and He controls everything. People who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus are under the control of sin and Satan. They don‚Äôt know what true freedom in Jesus Christ is. I can tell them that Jesus wants to give them forgiveness and freedom. Only through faith in Jesus a person can be free from sin and the influence of Satan (who is a fallen angel and always obeys what Jesus tells him to do when Jesus tells him to stop or leave).
		
	</p><p>For their act of kindness, Paul and Silas were put in prison! I always think that people in prison aren‚Äôt free but because Paul and Silas were believers their hearts were free and they could be joyful and sing songs to Jesus. The others heard them. When I suffer unjustly, I can still be joyful because I know that Jesus is with me. Even when I am suffering, I can praise Jesus and those around me will see that Jesus is my help, my strength and my joy.
		
	</p><p>God opened the doors of the prison. Through this miracle, Paul and Silas could share about Jesus with the jailer and his household. They all heard the Word of the Lord and believed in Jesus. People need to hear the truth about Jesus from the Bible. I can share with them what I know about Jesus from the Bible. I can tell them that only through faith in Jesus, we are saved.
		
	</p><p>To be in prison because of my faith in Jesus seems scary. But I see how everything works for good. That is, because Paul and Silas were in prison and sang songs to Jesus, the jailer and his family heard about Jesus and God saved them! I don‚Äôt always understand how God works, but I can trust Him. I believe that He is wise and kind and that He has a good plan for me and others. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to be joyful in You always and tell people that You are the Great Saviour! When I‚Äôm in a hard situation, help me to remember that you work all things for good!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
