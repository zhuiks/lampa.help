		<p>‚ÄúTake heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.  For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.  ‚ÄúWhat do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.  Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.‚Äù (Matt. 18:10-14)</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus says that I have an angel that always sees the face of God. Jesus watches over me. Jesus came to earth to save me and all people who believe in Him. Without Jesus, I am like a lost sheep, who lost its way in the mountains. Without Jesus‚Äô help, I will perish. But He seeks me and wants me to be a part of His flock so He can care for me always. How does He seek me? When I hear stories about Jesus, when I hear songs about Jesus, when people talk about Jesus, He calls me to Himself in those and many other ways. Through all those things, He reveals Himself to me so that I would come to Him. When I believe in Jesus, then He receives me into His kingdom where there is joy, peace and love. I can tell others about Jesus so that they would come to Him and know that Jesus is Saviour. Maybe they don‚Äôt know that life without Jesus is very dangerous.  I can tell them that Jesus wants to care for them, forgive their sin and receive them into His heavenly kingdom. Jesus, help me to tell people, my relatives, neighbors and friends that You want to and you can save them. This is your will, that people wouldn‚Äôt perish. (see also John 3:16)

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
