	Application
</h3>
		<p>I know that Jesus is in heaven now and that He will return to be King on earth. He  gives the Holy Spirit to believers so they can tell people about Him. He is always with me. He tells believers to go and make disciples (followers of Jesus) and to baptize them and to teach them Jesus‚Äô words. Am I a disciple of Jesus? If I am, then I have the Holy Spirit and Jesus is always with me. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please help me tell people that You are God, that You died for people‚Äôs sins, that You rose on the third day and that You forgive our sins and give us the Holy Spirit to live God‚Äôs way and to share about You with others. Help me to tell people all over the world about Your Great Love for them. </em>
	</p><p>Jesus will return (Acts 1:11). I am waiting for that day and want people to believe in Him so that can be forgiven now and be with Jesus forever. I don‚Äôt want people to be punished and to be without Jesus forever.  I want them to be glad in Jesus along with me now and also when He reigns in His eternal kingdom. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, thank you that You are coming soon and even though I don‚Äôt see you now, I know that you are always with me. But one day You will return and then I‚Äôll see You face to face!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
