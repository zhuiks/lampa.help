		<p>When Jesus was born, the wise men saw His star in heaven and understood that a King was born. They followed the star and came to King Herod in order to find out in which city the Messiah was supposed to be born. The religious leaders read the words of prophecy, where it is written that He was born in Bethlehem. They found Jesus there, worshipped Him and gave him treasures (gold, frankincense and myrrh).</p><p>God warned the wise men to go home by another way. God also sent an angel to Joseph in a dream to tell him to get away to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill Jesus. They left in the night for Egypt. Herod gave an order to kill all the baby boys under 2 years old in Bethlehem because he didn‚Äôt want Jesus to be king.</p><p>After Herod‚Äôs death, Joseph, Mary and Jesus returned and lived in Nazareth.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The wise men wanted to worship Jesus. They believed that He was King. God led them by the star so that they could worship Him. God led and warned the wise men and Joseph through dreams. They trusted God and followed Him. God leads me also.  He gave me the Bible that I can read to know what He speaks to me.
		
	</p><p>I know that Jesus is King. The wise men gave Him their treasures. I also can give Jesus all that is dear to me (my love, attention, obedience) because I love Him. I want to worship Jesus and show that He is the most important. The wise men travelled a long time to see Jesus. They searched for Him. I don‚Äôt need to look for Jesus (physically). When I read the Bible, I can know Him. Also, I can pray and know that He hears me. He is near and He leads me when I seek to live God‚Äôs way.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, help me and lead me. I worship You and trust You.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
