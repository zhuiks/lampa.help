		<p>God sent an angel to Zacharias the priest while he was serving Him to say that although he and his wife were childless and already old, He would give them a son, John. John would prepare the way for people to receive Jesus. Zecharias didn‚Äôt believe right away and the angel told him that he wouldn‚Äôt be able to speak until God‚Äôs Word to him was fulfilled (Luke 1:20). God said that John would be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother‚Äôs womb (Luke 1:15).</p><p>An angel told Mary that God chose her to give birth to the Son of God, Jesus.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>It seemed impossible that Zacharias and Elizabeth would have a son, it seemed impossible that Mary could have a baby but God promised long ago to send us a Saviour and He fulfilled His Word. He also promised that He would send a messenger to prepare the way for Jesus. This messenger is John the Baptist. The prophets Isaiah and Malachi spoke about John (see Is. 40:3, Mal. 3:1).  I can trust God and His Word. Jesus came into Mary‚Äôs womb by the Holy Spirit and that‚Äôs why I know that Jesus is sinless. He is God and man. For God nothing is impossible. Does something seem impossible in my life? I am confident that for Jesus it isn‚Äôt hard. It is good to follow the example of Mary and believe God‚Äôs Word. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, I praise you and and thank you that you saved me and forgave my sin. Thank you for doing the impossible! You are amazing!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
