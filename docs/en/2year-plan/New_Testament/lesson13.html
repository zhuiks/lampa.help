	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus was teaching the people about trusting God and loving others (Matt 5-7). That‚Äôs why He shared this parable about listening and doing His Word. He wants us to understand what it is like to really believe and live the truth. He explains what happens when we love God and follow His Word. I hear the Word of God at Sunday school. or maybe I read stories in a children‚Äôs Bible. When I hear and read, Jesus speaks to me. He not only wants me to hear interesting stories about Him but wants the things that I hear to change my heart. For example, when I hear that Jesus fed the people because He loved and cared for them, I remember that Jesus cares for me and I can ask Him to help me to care for others. If I have cookies, I can share them with someone and show them that I love them and want to care for them. I can tell them that Jesus loves them.
		
	</p><p>In this story, Jesus said that the rain and wind hit hard and destroyed the house that was built upon the sand. Rain and wind can represent problems in life. Sometimes we are sick or we aren‚Äôt getting along with someone or we are scared. When we trust Jesus (which is doing what He tell us to do), He is our Rock and Foundation of life. Problems can never be stronger than Jesus! I believe that Jesus is with me, that He is my help, that everything works for good, and that He holds me in His hands. But people who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus are like the house built upon the sand. When everything is bad in life, they fall. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me not only to hear Your Word but to trust You and to do the things that I hear from the Bible (to trust You and love others). Thank you that You help me to hear and fulfill Your Word, to Love You and others with my life.</em>
	</p><p>see also:  or 1 Cor. 3:11 ‚ÄúFor no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ‚Äù
		
	</p><p>James 1:21-22 ‚Äú‚Ä¶receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.‚Äù

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
