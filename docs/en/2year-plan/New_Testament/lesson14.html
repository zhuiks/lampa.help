	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus saw the paralyzed man by the pool where people were laying around and waiting, wanting to be healed. He asked him “Do you want to be made well?” The man answered that he couldn’t get into the pool for healing. Jesus told the man “Stand, take up your bed and walk.” The man was made well, stood, took his bed and walked! The spiritual leaders saw him and scolded him because he was walking around with his bed on the sabbath, but the healed man said that he was just doing what the One who had healed him told him to do. He didn’t know that Jesus had healed him. Jesus later found him and told him not to sin. The man told the spiritual leaders that Jesus had healed him. They got angry that Jesus healed on the sabbath. “But Jesus answered them: My Father has been working until now and I have been working.” (Jn. 5:17). Then they got even angrier because Jesus was calling God His Father and by this was saying that He is equal to God.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus wanted to heal the helpless man. He is God and He came to save me and everyone because we are all helpless without Him. He knew where that man went after he was healed and found him. He knows what is in people’s hearts and that’s why He warned the man not to sin. The man was carrying his bed around and it seems like he didn’t respect the spiritual leaders. Jesus always sees me and knows everything that is in my heart. He warns me through my conscience, through the Word and also through other people when I start to sin. He helps me to do what is right when I ask Him to help.
		
	</p><p>Like the Pharisees in the story, there are people who don’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus Himself said that He is God and did things that only God can do. He never sinned. He rose from the dead and He does miracles which give glory to God. Does Jesus have the first place in my life? He should be most important because He is God. He loves me very much and He is Almighty. He is worthy of my respect and love.  Jesus said in Jn. 5:24 “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life.”

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>

Хронологические планы уроков, обучающие видео для детского служения, идеи для изучения золотых стихов, идеи поделок и детские Библейские песни.\n\nabout = \n  Когда мы помогали в новой церкви в Средней Азии, наш пастор попросил команду детского служения разработать хронологическую Библейскую программу, которая была бы сосредоточена на том, как Христос виден в во всем Писании. Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
