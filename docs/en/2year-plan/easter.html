	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus ate with His friends. He loved them and washed their feet. one of them (Judas Iscariot) betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill him. Jesus explained to the disciples that He would die for them soon and gave them bread that symbolized His body and wine that symbolized His blood. He also told Peter that he would deny Jesus 3 times. Peter didn‚Äôt believe it.</p><p></p><p>At night, Jesus and His friends prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. But the disciples fell asleep. Jesus prayed to the Father and said, ‚Äúlet it be: not how I want it to be, but how You want it to be: (Matt. 26:39)</p><p></p><p>Judas Iscariot came with people and they took Jesus. They led Him to judgement before the religious leaders and to the Roman governor, Pilate. They wanted to kill Him, because He said that He is the Son of God, but they didn‚Äôt believe that He is the Son of God. Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent, but was afraid of the opinion of people and gave the order to crucify Jesus. At the time of the judgement, Peter denied Jesus 3 times, just like Jesus said. Peter cried. The soldiers treated Jesus very rudely; they hit Him and laughed at Him.</p><p></p><p>Jesus hung on the cross between 2 criminals. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised him that he would be with Him in paradise that day. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the curtain in the temple tore from top to bottom. Jesus said ‚ÄúIt is finished!‚Äù (Jn.19:30) He died.</p><p></p><p>The disciples saw that Jesus was buried in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it. On the third day, just as He said, Jesus rose again! The women came to anoint His body, but they saw angels that told them that He rose. A couple of disciples ran to the tomb and saw that He wasn‚Äôt there but they didn‚Äôt understand that He was alive. Some of the disciples saw the Risen Jesus right near the tomb.</p><p></p><p>Later, Jesus appeared to the other disciples in a new glorified body. He brought Peter back into close friendship with him after he had denied Him. He ate with His friends, spoke with them and gave them the Holy Spirit. He forgives the sins of all who trust Him. Jesus said, ‚ÄúThus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.‚Äù Luke 24:46-47.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I know that Jesus died for my sins and rose again. Only He lived a sinless life and only He can forgive my sin and cleanse me. I trust His righteousness and know that only through faith in Him, I am saved. I am not saved by good works or good behavior. Jesus saved me by His grace. Jesus is alive! I want to tell everyone about my salvation in Jesus! He loves us and wants to give us a heart that loves God and others. He promises to receive me in heaven so that I can be with Him forever!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
