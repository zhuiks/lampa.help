	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Long ago, God promised to send a saviour, who would be Immanuel, which means God with us. When the time came, God sent an angel to speak to Mary, to tell her that she would be given a baby from the Holy Spirit and that the baby would be Jesus, the Saviour that everyone had been waiting for. Mary believed and praised God. God told Joseph in a dream that Mary‚Äôs baby was from God. He believed God. When the time came for the baby to be born, Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem because the king (Caesar) wanted to count everyone in their hometowns. Nearby, shepherds were taking care of their sheep. Angels appeared to them to tell them about Jesus‚Äô birth. They went to Jesus and worshipped Him. They told people the good news. Later, wise men came from the east to worship Jesus. They followed a star that showed them that a King had been born. The star led them to Jesus and they gave Him expensive gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh and worshipped Him.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God sent Jesus to save me. He told the good news of Jesus‚Äôs birth to shepherds who were maybe poor and to wise men who were maybe rich. God made known the good news that Jesus is King and Saviour to the people nearby and to the people far away. Jesus is Saviour for all people. All people have sinned against God and need Jesus to forgive their sins and bring them into God‚Äôs family of love. God told us in His Word that He would send the Saviour and He did! God always does what He says He will do. I can trust the Bible and know that it is the truth. Jesus is God with us. He came down from heaven and became a person like me, only He is also God, so He never sinned. When I look to Him for help and trust Him, He answers and helps me. He is always with me. I want to tell people the Good News: that Jesus is Saviour, that He loves them, that He can forgive them and that He wants to be with them always. Jesus, I worship you!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
