	Application
</h3>
		<p>People came to Jesus because  they knew that He could help. I also can ask Jesus for help. Jesus has compassion and love for those who suffer (in this passage, the widow and the leper). He wanted to help them. He also wants to help and heal me, my family and friends. I know that Jesus loves me. I can pray to Jesus and ask Him for help.
		
	</p><p>The centurion knew that Jesus had authority and when He said something, it would happen. He knew that Jesus didn‚Äôt need to physically be present for his servant to be healed. I don‚Äôt see Jesus with my eyes right now but I believe that He hears my prayers, He sees my needs and He is always with me. Jesus was amazed when He heard of the centurion‚Äôs faith. Jesus loves it when I trust Him and talk with Him. Our faith is precious (valuable) to Him, more than gold (1 Pet. 1:7). The centurion respected Jesus and knew that he wasn‚Äôt worthy for Jesus to come to his house. I understand that I also am not worthy of Jesus‚Äôs love, grace and forgiveness. But when I believe in Him, He says that I can come to Him at any time and at any hour with any need. Jesus helped the centurion (a non-Jew) and through this I understand that God always had a plan to save not only the Jews but all other people as well. He is pleased when we come to Him. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, I believe that You are strong, that You are God and that You love me and help me. I love You, Jesus, and thank You for Your love and care towards me.</em>
	</p><p>Jesus also fulfills prophecy. Long ago, God promised to send Jesus. In the gospels, I see that God fulfilled His Word through Jesus. Jesus not only healed physical diseases, but He heals the worst disease of all: sin. He took my sin upon Himself and cleanses and forgives me when I believe in Him. I am saved by His grace, by faith in Jesus.  People were amazed and praised God when Jesus healed. I also am thankful and praise God that He heals. Just like Peter‚Äôs mother-in-law, I want to show Jesus my love and thankfulness. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you Jesus!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
