	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul said goodbye to the believers in Ephesus and went to Troas. Along the way, he saw believers from different cities. An international group of believers also came  to Paul and Luke (the writer of the book of Acts) in Troas. Paul preached into the night and one youth, Eutychus fell asleep and fell from the 3rd story window sill. Paul took him in his arms and Eutychus came alive. In the morning, Paul and his friends went on to Miletus where he called the leaders of the Ephesian church to come to him. He shared with them, that the Holy Spirit was telling him that he would suffer for the gospel in Jerusalem. Paul said, ‚ÄúBut I count my life of no value to myself, so that I may finish my course  and the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God‚Äôs grace.‚Äù (20:24) He warned them of false teachers and said, ‚ÄúAnd now I commit you to God and to the message of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.‚Äù (20:32)</p><p>On the way to Jerusalem, they stopped in Tyre where the believers there, by the Holy Spirit, told Paul not to go to Jerusalem. (21:4) In Caesarea, the prophet Agabus said that Paul would be arrested in Jerusalem. But Paul was ready to go to prison and even ready to die for the name of the Lord Jesus. (21:13). When Paul went to the temple in Jerusalem, the Jews grabbed him and the whole city was stirred up. They said that Paul taught people wrong and started to beat him. A Roman soldier came and took Paul out of the crowd as they were yelling, ‚Äútake him away!‚Äù Paul asked to speak to the crowd.</p><p>Paul told them how he came to believe in Jesus. When he told them that Jesus sent him to preach to the Gentiles, the crowd started yelling again. The soldier called for the Jews to meet in order to find out why they were accusing Paul.</p><p>At the meeting, the Pharisees and Sadducees couldn‚Äôt agree about Paul and started to argue. The Roman soldier took Paul to the barracks, ‚ÄúThe following night, the Lord stood by him and said, ‚ÄúHave courage! For as you have testified about Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.‚Äù (23:11) The Jews wanted to kill Paul, but the Roman soldier sent Paul away by night to the governor in Caesarea. There, he awaited a court hearing.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Paul experienced much joy as well as sorrow for the sake of his faith in Jesus. Jesus was always with him. He knew many people in different countries from different cultures. He loved them and they loved him. Jesus unified believers from different cultures. I am thankful to God for the family of God in Jesus Christ.
		
	</p><p>Perhaps people will accuse me of doing something evil because I am a believer in Jesus. Paul was in prison but God spoke to him and was always with him. God told him to ‚Äútake courage‚Äù and that he would testify of Jesus in Rome. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, give me boldness and strength to continue to trust You when it‚Äôs hard and to witness about You. Thank you that You are always with me. Help me to be a witness for You all the time and everywhere (at home, in school, with my family etc). Fill me with the Holy Spirit and speak to me so that people would know that You are the Savior of all.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
