		<p>Jesus was visiting someone‚Äôs home and when they were at the table, a certain woman came and worshipped Jesus.

The host, Simon the Pharisee said that Jesus shouldn‚Äôt let this woman even touch Him because she had a bad reputation in the town.</p><p>‚ÄúAnd Jesus answered and said to him, ‚ÄúSimon, I have something to say to you.‚Äù So he said, ‚ÄúTeacher, say it.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.  And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?‚Äù  Simon answered and said, ‚ÄúI suppose the one whom he forgave more‚Äù (v 40-43). Jesus said that the woman loved Jesus very much because she understood how much God had forgiven her. Simon didn‚Äôt greet Jesus well into his home in comparison to this woman. ‚ÄúTherefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.‚Äù (v. 47). Jesus told her that her sins were forgiven. The people were amazed that Jesus had authority to forgive sins.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Sometimes I am like Simon, who invites Jesus to be near me but I don‚Äôt really respect or love Him much. Jesus, forgive me and give me a heart that understands how much you have forgiven me, so that I would be like the woman who worshiped you out of thankfulness. It‚Äôs good to think about the price that Jesus paid for me to forgive my sin. He shed His blood. He gave His life in order to reconcile me to Himself. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you Jesus! I want to respect and love you with all of my life, with all that is important and valuable to me.</em>
	</p><p>Jesus didn‚Äôt stop the woman from worshipping Him because He is God and is worthy to receive worship. Her heart of worship and not her bad reputation was important to Him. Jesus is worthy of my worship. The bad things that I have done before shouldn‚Äôt keep me from coming to Jesus to receive forgiveness and salvation. He wants to forgive me and give me new life in the knowledge of Him.
		
	</p><p>The woman was thankful to Jesus. She had sinned before but Jesus had changed her life. She anointed Jesus‚Äô feet with precious oil and didn‚Äôt worry about the opinion of others. She simply worshiped Jesus. She demonstrated her thankfulness and didn‚Äôt hide her love. I also am thankful to Jesus for salvation and forgiveness. I also want to worship Him with my life. I love Jesus. How can I show Him my love? Am I afraid to show that I love Jesus? Why? 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, I ask you to take away the fear of people and to give me freedom to worship You.</em>
	</p><p>Jesus knew that the Pharisees thought poorly of the woman and didn‚Äôt understand His words of forgiveness. Jesus taught Simon, so that he would understand. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you Jesus that you teach me when I don‚Äôt understand or am thinking incorrectly about something. Help me to understand Your Love and not to judge people. I want to understand more how much you have forgiven me. I want to love you more!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
