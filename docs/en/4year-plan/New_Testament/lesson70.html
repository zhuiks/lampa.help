	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul was in Thessalonica (Acts 17:1-9) where people received Jesus as Savior. Other people there drove Paul and Silas out of town. The believers there were an example of faith for other believers in their region. They ‚Äú‚Ä¶ turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, 10 and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.</p><p>Paul wrote that they had come to Thessalonica from Philippi where they had been imprisoned for their faith in Jesus (Acts 16:22-40). Believers in Thessalonica suffered because of their faith at the hands of their people, just as Jesus suffered at the hands of the Jews (2:14). When Paul was waiting in Athens (Acts 17:15), Timothy went to Thessalonica in order to find out how the believers there were doing (3:1). Timothy passed on to Paul that the believers were standing in their faith in Jesus and Paul rejoiced. He wanted to go there and to strengthen their faith (3:10). Paul prayed for them, ‚ÄúNow may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you. 12 And may the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all, just as we do to you, 13 so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints‚Äú (3:11-13)</p><p>Paul wanted the Thessalonian believers to live pure and pleasing to God, ‚ÄúFor this is the will of God, your sanctification‚Ä¶ ‚Äú (4:3) That is, that the believers would live in holiness and in love. Paul explained what would happen in the end times, and told them not to worry when believers died. ‚Äú‚Ä¶For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.‚Äù (4:16-18)</p><p>Paul wrote that the Day of the Lord will come unexpectedly and that, ‚Äú‚Ä¶God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. 11 Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.‚Äù (5:9-11)</p><p>He taught them, ‚ÄúRejoice always, 17 pray without ceasing, 18 in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.19 Do not quench the Spirit. 20 Do not despise prophecies. 21 Test all things; hold fast what is good. 22 Abstain from every form of evil. 23 Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 24 He who calls you is faithful, who also will do it.‚Äú (5:16-24)</p></section>

		<p>I know that Jesus will return for me. The Day of the Lord will come, when God will judge all those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus. He will not judge believers because they trusted Him for salvation and received Jesus‚Äô sacrifice on the cross.

	</p><p> Just as the believers in Thessalonica experienced difficulties because of their faith in Jesus, I too will experience difficulties because of my faith in Jesus.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
