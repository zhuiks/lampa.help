	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>The Parable of the Great Supper Who was at the great supper and who wasn‚Äôt? Jesus invites many people to be with Him in heaven, but many people don‚Äôt want to come. Do I want to be with Jesus or is something more important for me?
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Counting the Cost: Do I know that following Jesus means that I already don‚Äôt live for myself? Am I ready to die to my selfish ambitions in order to obtain that which is better and eternal in Jesus?
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Salt: Believers should have an effect like salt (it keeps things from going bad and has a good influence). Those who don‚Äôt live for themselves but live for Jesus will be like salt. Those who say they believe Jesus but don‚Äôt follow Jesus with their lives are like tasteless salt that has no strength to keep things from going bad and no power to influence their surroundings for the better. Is my life filled with the power of the Holy Spirit? Do I have a positive influence on those around me, so that they would see the Love of Jesus through my life?
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Parable of the Unjust Steward: The unjust steward did not act rightly. Jesus uses him as an example for me, so that I would use what I have wisely and think about the future. The steward in the parable worried about his future and did everything he could so that others would receive him after he was fired. I should be wise and use what God has given me (money, position in society, possessions etc) and think about how they influence my future with God. How can I use money to influence my future in eternity? Maybe I can earn money honestly, buy Bibles and give them to people. Maybe I can give money to people who are working on translating the Bible into other languages, where they don‚Äôt yet have the Word of God. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to use everything wisely in a way that is pleasing to You.</em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Parable of the Rich man and Lazarus: My life on earth is short in comparison to eternity. God gives people opportunities and chances now  to trust Him and to be with Him after death. Even if I suffer here on earth, but love Jesus, I can know that eternal comfort and joy in heaven with Jesus await me. But people who live for riches now lose everything after death and will only receive torment for their unbelief. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please help me to have the right attitude towards life here on earth. Help me to remember that this life isn‚Äôt the end. I don‚Äôt want to have a selfish attitude towards life and only value what I can have here now on earth, but I want to have an unselfish attitude towards life and value that which endures forever even after earthly life has finished. Jesus, I love to know You and to make You known to people. You rose from the dead and conquered sin in order to give all people eternal life in the knowledge of You!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

God gives people opportunities and chances now  to trust Him and to be with Him after death. Even if I suffer here on earth, but love Jesus, I can know that eternal comfort and joy in heaven with Jesus await me. But people who live for riches now lose everything after death and will only receive torment for their unbelief. __Jesus, please help me to have the right attitude towards life here on earth. Help me to remember that this life isn‚Äôt the end. I don‚Äôt want to have a selfish attitude towards life and only value what I can have here now on earth, but I want to have an unselfish attitude towards life and value that which endures forever even after earthly life has finished. Jesus, I love to know You and to make You known to people. You rose from the dead and conquered sin in order to give all people eternal life in the knowledge of You!__\n"}</script></div>
