	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Cornelius was a Gentile (a non-Jew, a person from the nations) that loved God but didn‚Äôt know about Jesus. God sent an angel to him and told him to call Peter. Peter was a Jew and didn‚Äôt socialize with Gentiles. God showed him a vision when he prayed and said, ‚ÄúWhat God has cleansed you must not call unclean‚Äù (v. 15). Peter didn‚Äôt understand, but when people from Cornelius came looking for him, God told Peter to go with them.</p><p>Peter and some other Jewish believers went to Cornelius‚Äôs house where many people (Gentiles) were gathered. Cornelius wanted to bow to Peter, but he raised him up and said ‚ÄúI also am just a man.‚Äù Cornelius wanted to hear a message from God. Peter understood that he should share with them about salvation in Jesus and that they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúunclean Gentiles‚Äù but were people that Jesus wanted to save. When he shared about Jesus, the Holy Spirit came down on the Gentiles because they believed in Jesus. Peter and his friends were amazed that God gave the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit, just as He had given them. Then they were baptized in the name of Jesus.</p><p>In Chapter 11, the Jewish believes in Jerusalem heard that Peter was with Gentiles and started to be upset. But Peter said that God saved them and gave the Gentiles the same gift that He had given the Jews on the day of Pentecost, that is, the gift of the Holy Spirit.  Having understood this, the Jews rejoiced that God also saved the Gentiles. Because of persecution of believers in Jesus, some people went away to Antioch, where then many people turned to Jesus and so a church began.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Cornelius didn‚Äôt know much about God but worshipped Him and God heard his prayer and sent Peter to tell him about salvation in Jesus. The Jews thought that salvation in Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit was only for them but God showed them that salvation and the gift of the Holy Spirit is for every person who believes in Jesus. Cornelius invited many people to his house so they could hear from God. God saved many people that day when they heard about Jesus. Like Cornelius, I too want to seek God, love Him and invite people to hear about Jesus. I want to trust Jesus and worship Him. From this passage, I know that salvation in Jesus is for all who believe in Him!
		
	</p><p>Peter didn‚Äôt understand God‚Äôs plan right away. He didn‚Äôt understand the vision he saw, but he was obedient to God when He sent him to Cornelius. Later, Peter understood that God wanted to save the Gentiles. Sometimes when I pray and read the Bible, I don‚Äôt understand everything but God shows me what to do. Jesus, help me to do what your Word says and trust You even when I don‚Äôt understand everything. Peter told the people about Jesus and God saved them and poured out His Holy Spirit on them. I believe that today God wants to save people and use me to tell them about Jesus. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, show me who to share with and how to do it. Fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to tell people that You are the only Saviour!</em>
	</p><p>In the Bible, I see God‚Äôs plan to save everyone. He gave His Law to the Jews and made a special covenant with them. He always wanted them to be a light to other nations so that the nations would see that God is the only true God. He sent His Son Jesus to the Jews. Jesus was a Jew and fulfilled God‚Äôs Law that the Jews knew. It was always God‚Äôs plan that all believers in Jesus would be saved and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. God is merciful and generous! 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you, Jesus, that you saved me and died for me on the cross. You rose again and You are alive and You are Saviour of the world!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
