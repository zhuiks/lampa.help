		<p>After Paul and a group of believers were in Philippi, they traveled to many cities and shared about Jesus. They were in Ephesus.

Earlier, we were all under the influence of sin and were God‚Äôs enemies. But now, in Jesus each believer is a new creation of God that fulfills the plans that God has for them.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus saved me and changes my life. I used to be far from God and was His enemy. Believers in Jesus believe: that He is God, that He never sinned, that He fulfilled God‚Äôs law, that He took my punishment in my place for my disobedience, that He died and rose again, that He forgave my sin and gave me the Holy Spirit and that He loves me. Do I believe in Jesus? When I believe in Him, I love Him. When I love Him, I love other people, especially believers. When I believe in Him, I ask Him and He gives me strength to love Him and others and to resist evil. He helps me.
		
	</p><p>Jesus saved me and others by grace alone. Grace is when God gives me His undeserved kindness, mercy and love. No one deserves anything good from God, but Jesus offers me and all people His grace. I never can do enough good in order to be accepted by God. Only Jesus could fulfill the whole Law, die for the sin of the world and rise again. Now through Jesus and only through Jesus all the spiritual riches belong to me in Christ Jesus! I want to share this good news with other people. I don‚Äôt want them to be children of wrath who aren‚Äôt friends with God. I want them to become children of God through faith in Jesus and the knowledge of His love and grace. Who can I tell about Jesus‚Äô grace? 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to understand for myself and to share with others about your grace.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
