Paul trusted Jesus in all situations and wrote, ‚ÄúI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me‚Äù (4:13).

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Paul wrote this joyful letter from prison. Because Paul was in prison, he could share the gospel with different people. He was ready to live and die for Jesus, trusting Jesus in any situation. I also want to trust Jesus when everything is going well as well as when it is difficult. Jesus suffered because of love for me. Now, He is in glory. Maybe things are difficult for me right now, but I know that one day I will be with Jesus. My citizenship is in heaven! I have a permanent place to live there with Jesus.
		
	</p><p>Even in difficulties and suffering, I can have joy in Jesus. He gives me peace and wants me to share everything with Him and give it to Him. Jesus doesn‚Äôt want me to worry but rather wants me to trust Him in everything and even to thank Him when I pray to Him. Maybe I am not thankful for a painful situation but I can be thankful to Jesus that He is with me and He understands me and helps me.
		
	</p><p>__Jesus, help me to think about, ‚Äúwhatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise‚Äù (4:8). You, Jesus are true and You are honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable, excellent and worthy of praise. You are my joy. Teach me to be joyful in You all the time. __

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
