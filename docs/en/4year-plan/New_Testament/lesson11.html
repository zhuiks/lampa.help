	Summary
</h3>
		<p>John the Baptist‚Äôs disciples knew that Jesus was also baptizing people. They told John that many people who had been following John had now started following Jesus. John the Baptist said that he was glad that Jesus had come. John said that he himself was not the Christ but simply the one who prepared the way for the groom (Jesus). He said, ‚ÄúHe must increase, but I must decrease.‚Äù (Jn. 3:30) He also said that Jesus came from above and that He is above all. He taught about Jesus, saying that those who receive Him believe that God is true (3:33).</p><p>When talking with the Pharisees, John explained that Jesus speaks the Word of God and that He gives the Holy Spirit without measure (v. 34). ‚ÄúThe Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand. 36 He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him‚Äù (3:35-36).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>John the Baptist fulfilled prophecy when he spoke to people about Jesus Christ. He was humble and was ready to give Jesus glory because he believed that Jesus was greater than everyone and everything. His life pointed people to Jesus. I want my life to point people to Jesus, so that they would know that He is God, that He is greater than everything and everyone, and that they would have life in Him.
		
	</p><p>I believe in Jesus and know that He gives me the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a person of the Trinity and He lives in every believer. When I need help to understand something, to do something,  to live God‚Äôs way or to share about Jesus, the Holy Spirit helps me without measure! I can rely upon Jesus. It‚Äôs very important for people to believe in Jesus, to trust Him and to love HIm. I have eternal life when I believe in Jesus. Eternal life means: new relationship with God (forgiveness of sins, the filling of the Holy Spirit, reconciliation with God, Jesus‚Äô joy and love, assurance that I belong to God and will be with Him forever). People who don‚Äôt trust Him and don‚Äôt love Jesus don‚Äôt have this life, this joy and this hope. I want to tell them about Jesus so that they would hear about how He is great and how He came to save them. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me by the Holy Spirit to love You and to tell people about You! You are Great!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
