		<p>Verses 1-24: Jesus sent out 72 disciples to share in cities where he planned to go and heal people and share about God‚Äôs kingdom. They returned rejoicing about what they had done.

He lay there, wounded on the road. Later, a priest walked by, saw him but didn‚Äôt stop to help him. The next person was a Levi. He also passed by and didn‚Äôt help the wounded man lying on the road. The third person was a Samaritan. He helped him and paid for his treatment to get better.</p><p>Jesus then asked, which of the 3 people was a neighbor to the wounded man.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>In this passage, a person asked Jesus a question. I too can ask God questions and know that answers are found in the Bible. The person wanted to have eternal life. How can I know if I will live eternally with Jesus? Do I love God? Can I love Jesus more? How? In Jesus‚Äô parable, 2 people who were Jews didn‚Äôt stop to help the Jew who was hurt. Do I sometimes not help my friends or my parents? Why don‚Äôt I help? Maybe I‚Äôm in a hurry? Many it‚Äôs inconvenient? Maybe I‚Äôm afraid?
		
	</p><p>Then the Samaritan, who historically wasn‚Äôt friends with the Jews, decided to stop and help the man. Samaritans and Jews were enemies, but he helped him. Which people groups today don‚Äôt really like one another? What does God want me to do when I see that my ‚Äúenemy‚Äù is suffering?
		
	</p><p>Jesus loved me when I was still a sinner and His enemy (Rom 5:10). He died for me and for all people in the world. Jesus loved me and now because I love Jesus and am thankful to Him for salvation and forgiveness and eternal life, I want to love others and show them Jesus‚Äô love. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">God, help me to love You and my neighbor. Show me how to love more and give me boldness and strength to love when it is hard.</em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Regarding v. 38-42: Jesus teaches that fellowship with Him (whether we are serving or sitting) is most important. He wants me to love Him and others regardless of what I am doing. Martha served but she was anxious about many things and Jesus wanted her to choose relationship with HIm, something that cannot be taken away. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to love You and others in all that I do.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
