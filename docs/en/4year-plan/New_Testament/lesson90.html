	<section><h3>
	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 1 Earlier, God spoke to us through his prophets, but now he speaks to us through Jesus, His Son. Jesus is greater than the prophets. Jesus is God. ‚ÄúThe Son is the radiance of God‚Äôs glory and the exact expression of His nature, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After making purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.4 So He became higher in rank than the angels, just as the name He inherited is superior to theirs.‚Äù 1:3-4. Jesus is Creator. He is greater than the angels, the angels are a part of creation that serve believers in Jesus (1:14).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 2 We should not fall away from the truth, but hold on to it. Jesus conquered the devil and freed believers. He Himself endured temptation and can help those who are tempted (2:18).</p><p></p><p>Ch.3 Jesus is greater than Moses, who led the people out of slavery and through the wilderness. God wanted to give them rest but some people didn‚Äôt trust God and that is why they could not enter into His rest (3:19).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 4 Jesus is greater than Joshua, who led the people into the promised land. Through faith, we can enter into God‚Äôs rest. ‚ÄúLet us then make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience. 12 For the word of God is living and effective and sharper than any double-edged sword, penetrating as far as the separation of soul and spirit, joints and marrow. It is able to judge the ideas and thoughts of the heart.‚Äù 4:11-12. Jesus is our High Priest. ‚ÄúFor we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tested in every way as we are, yet without sin. 16 Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us at the proper time.‚Äù 4:15-16.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 5 Jesus is God‚Äôs Son. He is greater than the High Priest. In the Old Testament there was a priest by the name of Mechidezek. He was a type of Jesus (5:9). According to the Law, only the sons of Aaron could be priests in Israel, but Jesus is a High Priest in the order of Melchidezek. The author wanted believers to understand the truth and become mature (5:14).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 6 God wants people to trust His Word and promises. There is hope in Jesus, ‚ÄúWe have this hope as an anchor for our lives, safe and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain‚Äù (6:19). *behind the curtain = the holy place where God is</p><p></p><p>Ch. 7 Jesus is the Eternal Priest. He lives forever to intercede for believers. Jesus is the better hope and guarantee of a better covenant. ‚ÄúTherefore, He is always able to save those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.‚Äù (7:25). Jesus gave Himself as a sacrifice for sin once and for all.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 8: Jesus intercedes for believers as a priest in heaven. The old covenant was a shadow of the new covenant which Jesus perfected.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 9: In the Old Testament, there was the tabernacle where people worshipped God. At that time,  the high priest brought the blood into the holy of holies once a year for the forgiveness of sins, but Jesus paid for sin by bringing His own blood into God the Father‚Äôs presence and obtained eternal redemption for people (9:12 and 24). ‚Äú‚Ä¶ without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.‚Äú (9:22). ‚ÄúAnd just as it is appointed for people to die once‚Äîand after this, judgment‚Äî 28 so also the Messiah, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.‚Äú (9:27-28).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 10: The Law pointed to Jesus; the Law doesn‚Äôt save. The blood of animals could not pay for sin. Believers become holy once and for all through the sacrifice of Jesus. He is now in heaven at the right hand of God the Father. He forgave believers and this is why sacrifices are no longer needed.</p><p>Believers can go to God through faith in Jesus and His sacrifice for them. ‚Äú let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. 23 Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. 24 And let us be concerned about one another in order to promote love and good works, 25 not staying away from our worship meetings, as some habitually do, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day drawing near.‚Äú (10:22-25).</p><p>Knowing this truth, believers shouldn‚Äôt sin or fear difficulties and suffering for their faith. The author writes, ‚ÄúSo don‚Äôt throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.‚Äú (10:35). Jesus is coming again and thinking about this, believers should stand in faith in HIm. (10:37).</p><p></p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>I believe that Jesus is the Son of God. He is greater than the prophets, the angels, Moses, Joshua and the High Priests. Everything in the Old Testament (the Law, the tabernacle, the sacrifices and the priesthood) point to Jesus. I deserve death and punishment for my sin against the Holy God. People earlier brought sacrifices of animals according to the law so that the blood of the animal would cover their sin. But the priests needed to constantly bring sacrifices for themselves and the people because the blood of animals could not give them a new heart and new relationship with God. Jesus is God and man. He never sinned and gave Himself as a sacrifice for my sin. This is why He is the perfect sacrifice and could pay for my sin once and for all. He always lives to intercede for me.
		
	</p><p> How does this truth change my life? I trust the sacrifice of Jesus for my salvation and not my works according to the law. He gives me rest through faith in His sacrifice. He helps me to love others and trust the Word. When I‚Äôm scared and people are against me, I can stand firm in my faith in Jesus. I know that He is the One Savior. I know that He is my Salvation. I know that He will come soon and I will be with Him forever. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, You are a Great Savior. Thank you for Your perfect sacrifice. Help me to stand firm in faith even when I suffer because of it. Thank you that through Jesus, I can come boldly to God for grace and help. You live forever and are always my help. Praise to You!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Jesus is our High Priest. ‚ÄúFor we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tested in every way as we are, yet without sin. 16 Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us at the proper time.‚Äù 4:15-16.\n\n  Ch. 5 Jesus is God‚Äôs Son. He is greater than the High Priest. In the Old Testament there was a priest by the name of Mechidezek. He was a type of Jesus (5:9). According to the Law, only the sons of Aaron could be priests in Israel, but Jesus is a High Priest in the order of Melchidezek. The author wanted believers to understand the truth and become mature (5:14).\n\n  Ch. 6 God wants people to trust His Word and promises. There is hope in Jesus, ‚ÄúWe have this hope as an anchor for our lives, safe and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain‚Äù (6:19). *behind the curtain = the holy place where God is\n\n  Ch. 7 Jesus is the Eternal Priest. He lives forever to intercede for believers. Jesus is the better hope and guarantee of a better covenant. ‚ÄúTherefore, He is always able to save those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.‚Äù (7:25). Jesus gave Himself as a sacrifice for sin once and for all.\n\n  Ch. 8: Jesus intercedes for believers as a priest in heaven. The old covenant was a shadow of the new covenant which Jesus perfected.\n\n  Ch. 9: In the Old Testament, there was the tabernacle where people worshipped God. At that time,  the high priest brought the blood into the holy of holies once a year for the forgiveness of sins, but Jesus paid for sin by bringing His own blood into God the Father‚Äôs presence and obtained eternal redemption for people (9:12 and 24). ‚Äú‚Ä¶ without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.‚Äú (9:22). ‚ÄúAnd just as it is appointed for people to die once‚Äîand after this, judgment‚Äî 28 so also the Messiah, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.‚Äú (9:27-28).\n\n  Ch. 10: The Law pointed to Jesus; the Law doesn‚Äôt save. The blood of animals could not pay for sin. Believers become holy once and for all through the sacrifice of Jesus. He is now in heaven at the right hand of God the Father. He forgave believers and this is why sacrifices are no longer needed.\n  Believers can go to God through faith in Jesus and His sacrifice for them. ‚Äú let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. 23 Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. 24 And let us be concerned about one another in order to promote love and good works, 25 not staying away from our worship meetings, as some habitually do, but encouraging each other, and all the more as you see the day drawing near.‚Äú (10:22-25).\n  Knowing this truth, believers shouldn‚Äôt sin or fear difficulties and suffering for their faith. The author writes, ‚ÄúSo don‚Äôt throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.‚Äú (10:35). Jesus is coming again and thinking about this, believers should stand in faith in HIm. (10:37).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- He is now at the right hand of God the Father\n- He is the Lamb of God\n- He is Savior\n- He is the High Priest\n- He never sinned\n- His sacrifice paid once and for all for sin\n- Jesus gives forgiveness\n- He intercedes for believers\n- He lives forever\n- Jesus gives us access to God\n- He is coming soon\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is the Son of God. He is greater than the prophets, the angels, Moses, Joshua and the High Priests. Everything in the Old Testament (the Law, the tabernacle, the sacrifices and the priesthood) point to Jesus. I deserve death and punishment for my sin against the Holy God. People earlier brought sacrifices of animals according to the law so that the blood of the animal would cover their sin. But the priests needed to constantly bring sacrifices for themselves and the people because the blood of animals could not give them a new heart and new relationship with God. Jesus is God and man. He never sinned and gave Himself as a sacrifice for my sin. This is why He is the perfect sacrifice and could pay for my sin once and for all. He always lives to intercede for me.\n   How does this truth change my life? I trust the sacrifice of Jesus for my salvation and not my works according to the law. He gives me rest through faith in His sacrifice. He helps me to love others and trust the Word. When I‚Äôm scared and people are against me, I can stand firm in my faith in Jesus. I know that He is the One Savior. I know that He is my Salvation. I know that He will come soon and I will be with Him forever. __Jesus, You are a Great Savior. Thank you for Your perfect sacrifice. Help me to stand firm in faith even when I suffer because of it. Thank you that through Jesus, I can come boldly to God for grace and help. You live forever and are always my help. Praise to You!__\n"}</script></div>
