	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Nicodemus was a Pharisee (a spiritual leader in Israel) who came to talk to Jesus at night. He believed that Jesus was from God. Jesus told him that a person needs to be born from above (or born again) in order to see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus didn‚Äôt understand Jesus‚Äô words. Jesus explained that people had already been born physically and had a body but that people still needed to be born spiritually with the help of the Holy Spirit. It was still hard for Nicodemus to understand Jesus.</p><p>Jesus said, ‚ÄúNo one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 ‚ÄúHe who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. 20 For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. 21 But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God‚Äù(Jn 3:13-21).</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Nicodemus came to Jesus with questions. I also can ask God when I don‚Äôt understand something. Most often, Jesus answers me through the Bible. The Bible is the truth and within it are the answers to the questions about God, the world, and people.
		
	</p><p>Jesus shared an example from the history of Israel when the people had sinned and God told them to look at a bronze snake hanging on a pole (Num. 21:4-9). Those who looked up at the bronze snake on the pole, where their sin was judged, were saved by God. When I look to Jesus in faith, believing that He died on the cross for my sin and took my punishment upon Himself, He saves me and  gives me new life. When I believe in Jesus I am not judged by God for my sin. He conquered sin and death. He forgives my sin.
		
	</p><p>I know that God loves me because He sent Jesus to die for me. I want to live in the light, that is, live honestly and openly before God and not hide from Him. I want to tell people about the love of Jesus, so that they would also look to Jesus and receive salvation through faith in Him. Jesus is the only way of salvation.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
