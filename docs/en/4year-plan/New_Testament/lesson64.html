	Application
</h3>
		<p>With my tongue, I say things that are pleasing to God and that are not pleasing to God. I need Jesus’ help to control my tongue. Jesus said that my words come out of my heart, “But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart.” (Matt. 15:18). Only Jesus can give me a new heart that loves God and others. When He changes my heart, He changes my life. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, give me a humble heart that depends upon You for life, love and wisdom. Jesus, give me wisdom that brings righteousness. Teach me to be wise, Jesus, and to not seek my own, but to seek what is pleasing to You.</em>
	</p><p>When I don’t get what I want, I should examine the motives of my heart and look at my life. Am I living in a way that is pleasing to God? Do I have right desires and relationships with people? If Jesus shows me that there is a desire or action that is displeasing, I should repent and humble myself before God. He loves when I come to Him for help and He promises to draw near to me.
		
	</p><p>God doesn’t want me to say bad things about others, especially believers. I myself am not perfect. Only Jesus is perfect and has the right to judge people. If I judge someone, I am saying that I’m higher than God’s Law. Jesus, thank you for Your mercy and salvation. I humble myself before You. I want to trust Jesus with my life, desires and dreams. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, give me a heart that trusts you in everything.</em>
	</p><p>In chapter 5, James warns the rich who are trusting their riches and aren’t treating others right. I don’t want to trust in riches or abuse authority over people because that is not pleasing to God. Jesus, help me to have a right attitude towards money, knowing that everything belongs to You. All that You give, I want to use rightly, in a way that is pleasing to You. James also writes to those who are suffering and wants them to continue to trust Jesus, knowing that He is coming soon. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to know, that Your arrival is at hand (soon). Help me to trust You and have expectation in Your Heavenly Kingdom and not in a material kingdom for myself here on earth. </em>
	</p><p>God hears the prayers of the righteous. Who is righteous before God? Jesus is my righteousness. When I humble myself before God and recognize that only Jesus is righteous that that His righteousness saves me, then He imputes to me His righteousness and I become righteous before God. Only through Jesus, can I be righteous in God’s eyes. Then, through faith in Jesus, God hears my prayers. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you, Jesus, for Your righteousness, for Your salvation. Thank you that You forgive my sin, heal me and draw me near to You. I humble myself before You. You alone are righteous. I worship You.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Хронологические планы уроков, обучающие видео для детского служения, идеи для изучения золотых стихов, идеи поделок и детские Библейские песни.\n\nabout = \n  Когда мы помогали в новой церкви в Средней Азии, наш пастор попросил команду детского служения разработать хронологическую Библейскую программу, которая была бы сосредоточена на том, как Христос виден в во всем Писании. Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
