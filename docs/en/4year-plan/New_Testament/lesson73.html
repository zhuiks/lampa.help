	Summary

		<p>When Paul was in Corinth, he met Aquila and Priscilla. Silas and Timothy came later. (Acts 18). Paul taught there for 1 ¬Ω years. (Acts 18:11) Later, when Paul was in Antioch and Galatia, Apollos also taught people in Corinth. Paul was thankful to God for the Corinthians‚Äô faith in Jesus. He wrote the Corinthian believers that they should have unity and not division between them. Some learned the truth about Jesus from Paul and others from Apollos. Later, the people were divided and boasted about their teachers but really, they all belonged to Jesus. ‚ÄúBut of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God‚Äîand righteousness and sanctification and redemption‚Äî 31 that, as it is written, ‚ÄúHe who glories, let him glory in the Lord. ‚Äú (1:30-31)</p><p>Paul explained that God gives wisdom from the Holy Spirit that is not like the world‚Äôs wisdom. Believers have the mind of Christ. (2:16) The Corinthian believers weren‚Äôt acting wisely or spiritual. Paul wrote that Jesus is the most important, ‚Äú For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. ‚Äú (3:11) The apostles were only people. Paul said, ‚ÄúLet a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. ‚Äú (4:1) He wanted them to be humble.</p><p>Paul heard that some of the believers there were sinning in their relationships and boasting about it. ‚Äú But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner‚Äînot even to eat with such a person. 12 For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? 13 But those who are outside God judges. Therefore ‚Äúput away from yourselves the evil person.‚Äú (5:11-13)</p><p>Paul didn‚Äôt want believers to act like unbelievers and bring each other to court. Before their repentance, they had been in their sin and guilty before God, ‚ÄúAnd such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.‚Äú (6:11)</p><p>Believers should live in purity. ‚Äú Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? 20 For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God‚Äôs.‚Äú (6:19-20)</p><p>In chapter 7, Paul wrote about purity in relationships for those who are married and for those who are single. in chapter 8, he wrote that believers should love and respect one another and not hurt one another.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>My faith in Jesus changes how I live. I want to remember that whoever my mentor or teacher in the faith was, I should boast in Jesus Christ alone. He is the Author of my salvation. He is God. I respect those who teach me the Word but they are only God‚Äôs servants. We all should be humble before God and one another.
		
	</p><p>Sometimes there are people who call themselves believers but they live in sin and act worldly. The Bible says that I shouldn‚Äôt live in sin like the world. I shouldn‚Äôt have close fellowship with believers who are living in sin until they repent. God doesn‚Äôt want His people to live for themselves. His Holy Spirit lives in me and I am the temple of God. A temple is a place where God is worshiped. I want to worship God with my body, mind, actions and words. Jesus, be praised in all that I do (study in school, play with friends, help at home, fellowship with people).
		
	</p><p>Paul wrote the Corinthians because he wanted them to become mature in Christ. He told them things that were difficult and not pleasant to hear. But he told them out of love for them. maybe someone will tell me that I‚Äôm not quite living according to the Word.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, help me to be humble in heart. Help me to submit to You and to the Word. Help me listen to the Holy Spirit and do what You tell me to do or stop doing what is not pleasing to You. </em>
	</p><p>Sometimes, I am just reading the Bible (for example the letter to the Corinthians ) and God Himself convicts me through His Word. Jesus, teach me and change me that I would always be ready to hear from You. Help me to love You and others from a pure heart with my words and actions.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Help me listen to the Holy Spirit and do what You tell me to do or stop doing what is not pleasing to You. __\n  Sometimes, I am just reading the Bible (for example the letter to the Corinthians ) and God Himself convicts me through His Word. Jesus, teach me and change me that I would always be ready to hear from You. Help me to love You and others from a pure heart with my words and actions.\n\n  *Teacher!
