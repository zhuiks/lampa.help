	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus spoke to the people and explained to them who He is. He talked about shepherds, their work, responsibilities and how they treat their sheep. A good shepherd will take good care of his sheep and protect them from enemies. Sheep gather into the sheep pen to rest. Jesus said that He is the door to the place of rest. Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. A shepherd speaks to his sheep that they know his voice and follow him. There are robbers that only want to hurt the sheep (v. 10). Jesus said, ‚ÄúI am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep‚Äù (v. 11)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. That means that He is caring and He protects those who believe in Him. When I believe in Him, He is like my ‚Äúshepherd‚Äù that leads me, speaks to me, protects me and gives me rest and cares for me. He is like a door, which means that through faith in Him I can come into God‚Äôs rest.
		
	</p><p>There are those who are robbers. They don‚Äôt want to care for me. Maybe someone will tell me that I don‚Äôt need to believe in Jesus for salvation. They are not telling the truth. Jesus warned me about them. Jesus gave His life for me on the cross. That‚Äôs why I know that He loves me. He rose to life on the the third day and He is alive and that‚Äôs why I know that He can protect, save and lead me. He loves me and wants me to follow Him. He speaks to me through the Bible and through my conscience (that is, the Holy Spirit speaks to my conscience). I know His voice and I want to follow Him. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, thank you that you are my Good Shepherd. Help me to hear your voice and follow You. I am glad that You take care of me.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
