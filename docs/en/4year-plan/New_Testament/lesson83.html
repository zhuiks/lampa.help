		<p>Paul went to Jerusalem and was arrested there for his faith in Jesus. God gave him an opportunity to share about salvation in Jesus with many kinds and leaders during the time when he was imprisoned and waited for the decision about his case in court. Paul was a Roman citizen and had a right to speak with the Roman king (Caesar) about his case. The governor allowed this and sent him to Caesar. (Acts 25:12)</p><p>Paul (a prisoner for his faith in Jesus) sailed on the ship with other prisoners. Some of Paul‚Äôs friends sailed with him. Paul knew that the weather was bad for traveling but the captain decided to sail. They ended up in a storm that lasted for 2 weeks! God sent His angel to Paul who said, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you‚Äù (27:24). Paul believed God‚Äôs word and encouraged everyone. There was a shipwreck and all 276 people made it to shore on the island of Malta. The Maltese helped them to build a fire. When Paul was helping, a snake bit him and hung on his arm! All the locals thought that this was punishment from God but Paul didn‚Äôt get sick from the snake bite. God healed people on the island through Paul.</p><p>Then they traveled on to Rome. There Paul lived in a house with soldiers while he waited for his court case. He gathered with the Jews and told them about Jesus. Some believed and some didn‚Äôt. Paul said that God wants to save the Gentiles too. ‚ÄúThen Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.‚Äù (28:30-31).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Paul became a prisoner for his faith in Jesus. He saw that God had a plan for him. He didn‚Äôt stop talking to people about Jesus even when he was a prisoner. I know that God has a good plan for my life which He wants to fulfill. Wherever I am, I can be sure that Jesus is with me, that He is my help and that nothing can stop God from fulfilling His plan. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to tell people about Your love and about how You want to forgive their sins and give them new life in You.</em>
	</p><p>Sometimes Paul was in scary situations but Jesus always was with him and helped him to boldly share about Him. Jesus, help me to not be afraid but to trust You and always boldly tell people that You are Saviour. When Paul shared, some people believed in Jesus and some didn‚Äôt. When I share about Jesus, some people will believe in Him and some will not. I must simply tell the truth and pray that God would save them. I want to pray for the salvation of ______________ (name).
		
	</p><p>God wants to save everyone from every people group. Paul was Jewish and when he traveled, he began by telling the Jews about Jesus. But he also shared with the Gentiles and many of them believed in Jesus. Maybe it‚Äôs easy for me to tell people of my our nationality about Jesus, and maybe it‚Äôs hard. Jesus will lead me and show me who to share with and how.
		
	</p><p>__Jesus, I know that You want everyone to know You. In heaven, people from all different nations, tribes and languages will praise You! Thank you that you are always with me. Lead me and use my life so that many people and many nations would love You and worship You! You are worthy!__

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
