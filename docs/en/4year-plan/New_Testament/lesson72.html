		<p>After Paul was in Corinth, he went to Antioch.

He was in Antioch and later went back to the regions of Galatia and Phrygia (modern day Turkey) to strengthen the disciples (18:23) Aquila and Priscilla were in Ephesus. They met Apollos and helped him to better understand the truth about Jesus.

They had never heard of the Holy Spirit and didn‚Äôt know about the baptism of Jesus. They were then baptized in the name of Jesus and also received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I can always know more about Jesus and love Him more. Apollos knew about Jesus, but Aquila and Priscilla taught him more about Him. Just like Apollos, I can share with people about Jesus. Paul told believers in Ephesus about the Holy Spirit. Do I know about the Holy Spirit? The Holy Spirit is God. He fills and overflows believers in Jesus. He gives me strength to witness about Jesus (Acts 1:8). He teaches me and guides me. Often in the book of Acts, I read about how the Holy Spirit showed believers where to go or gave them wisdom to share about Jesus. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit.
		
	</p><p>I know that Jesus has authority over everything and everyone. I submit to Him. People wanted to drive demons out in the name of Jesus, but they themselves didn‚Äôt know Jesus. The demons submit to Jesus and not to people. They submit to Him because Jesus is God and He is Almighty. Believers in Ephesus saw that only Jesus is worthy of worship and this is why they burned their magic books that were not pleasing to Him. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Holy Spirit, show me if there is anything in my life that is not pleasing to You, so that I would remove it and be sanctified unto You.</em>
	</p><p>Paul taught for a long time in Ephesus. As always, there were people who believed in Jesus and those who didn‚Äôt. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to share with people about You and not grow weary when some people don‚Äôt want to love You and follow You. Help me to love You and follow You, no matter what.</em>
	</p><p>Demetrius was angry at Paul and his teaching when people stopped buying his idols. He started a riot. Even today, there are people who for the sake of money or power cause problems for believers. I worship Jesus and won‚Äôt spend money of that which is not pleasing to Him. Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to act when unbelievers are acting against me and other believers. Despite these events, Paul didn‚Äôt stop sharing with people about the only Savior, Jesus! 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, lead me also and help me to share with people about You. You alone are Savior. I don‚Äôt want people to go to hell, but want them to be in Your kingdom of Love.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
