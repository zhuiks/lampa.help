		<p>Paul writes that Titus and some other brothers were going to Corinth. The church was preparing an offering to support other believers in their need. (8:14) ‚ÄúGod loves a cheerful giver‚Äù (9:7)</p><p>Someone questioned Paul‚Äôs authority to speak to and correct the Corinthian church.He wrote,‚ÄúFor though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. 4 For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, 5 casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ‚Äù (10:3-5) God gave Paul a responsibility to build up believers and to not destroy their faith (10:8) False teachers came to Corinth and Paul was concerned about the believers there. (11:4) The false teachers seemed to be right but even satan can look like an angel of light. (11:13-15) Paul had many concerns for those who heard the gospel and this proved that he didn‚Äôt live for himself but for Christ, that people would know Jesus. (11:22-30)</p><p>God showed Paul a vision of heaven and afterwards, humbled him with a physical ailment . Paul asked 3 times for healing and wrote, ‚ÄúAnd He said to me, ‚ÄúMy grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in needs, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ‚Äôs sake. For when I am weak, then I am strong.‚Äù (12:9-10)</p><p>Paul was ready to serve and love believers there even if they didn‚Äôt love and respect him. He wanted them to be edified in Christ. (12:15, 19) He planned to go to Corinth and wanted the church to trust Jesus. ‚Äú Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?‚Äîunless indeed you are disqualified. ‚Äù (13:5)  He wanted people to live by faith in Jesus and not in sin. ‚ÄúFinally, brethren, farewell.

Be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.‚Äù (13:11) ‚ÄúThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>During Paul‚Äôs time, the believers were helping one another in their need. Today also, believers all around the world support one another in prayer and materially. How can I help my brothers and sisters with their needs? I can pray for them or maybe pass on some of my unneeded clothing to them. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">God, show me how to be a cheerful giver.</em>
	</p><p> People came to Corinth and said bad things about Paul. But Paul‚Äôs life proved that he wanted to edify believers and not ruin them. He always spoke about Jesus and wanted people to follow Jesus. There will be false teachers in churches. There will be people who will say bad things about others. My job is to hold on tight to the truth about Jesus in the Bible, check everything that they say with the Word of God and also look at the lives of those who are speaking poorly of others. Jesus, guard me from deceit. A true teacher from God will edify my faith in Jesus and not tear it down .
		
	</p><p>God wants me to be close to Him. He doesn‚Äôt want me to continue in a sinful lifestyle. That‚Äôs why Paul wrote, ‚ÄúExamine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. ‚Äú (13:5) 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Holy Spirit, show me my heart and correct me. I want to trust Jesus in everything and live pleasing to Him. Give me Your strength, wisdom and love. I love You, Jesus.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
