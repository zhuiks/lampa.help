	Application
</h3>
		<p>What do I believe about Jesus? What I believe about Him determines my relationship before God: how I live, what is in my heart, where I will be in eternity. What I believe about Jesus determines whose control I am under (demons, the world, Jesus). It determines what kingdom I‚Äôm in now (the heavenly one (Col. 1:13) or the earthly one (Eph. 2:2) and to what family I belong (the family of God, see Matt. 12:50 or not the family of God, see Eph 2:4). What I believe about Jesus makes me either a good or bad tree. What I believe in my heart about Jesus will be visible through my words. When I believe in Jesus can I say bad things about another person? Can I tell a lie? Can I answer people rudely or impatiently? When I believe in Jesus I am like the good tree that brings good fruit. I remember the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 2:22-23).
		
	</p><p>When I trust Jesus, I don‚Äôt want to say something bad because Jesus‚Äô love is in my heart. I love God and others and I can express this love in words sometimes. In the passage, people rudely accused Jesus saying that He drove out demons with demonic power. They were showing with their words that they didn‚Äôt trust Jesus. I can tell people what I believe about Jesus. I can tell them that He is great and greater than all. I can tell them about Jesus‚Äô love and also show them the love of Jesus with my actions. Just as a tree brings forth fruit, so my life can bring God‚Äôs love to people. Jesus, help me to trust You and show people that You are greater than all.
		
	</p><p>Jesus came to the Jews but many of them didn‚Äôt receive Him even though He was their long-awaited Savior of whom the Law and Prophets spoke. Jesus is the Saviour of All who trust in Him. This is why Jesus gave the example of Gentiles who repented and sought God. The Ninevites at the time of Jonah responded to the call to repentance and humbled themselves before God. Jesus called the Jews to repentance but some of them didn‚Äôt want to repent. During Solomon‚Äôs time, the Queen of Sheba came from afar to see the king‚Äôs glory and seek his wisdom. People stood before Jesus and didn‚Äôt want to repent of their sins and didn‚Äôt want to hear the wisdom of Jesus, the King of the Universe. Today also, Jesus is greater than the prophet Jonah. He calls me and others to repentance. Do I want to come to Jesus to be justified, forgiven and sanctified? Today, Jesus is greater than Solomon. Jesus is a Glorious King who has all wisdom. Do I want to come to Jesus and become a part of His kingdom and receive wisdom from Him?
		
	</p><p>(to better understand Matt. 12:32, see John 15:26, 16:8-15 and Acts 1:8. The Holy Spirit testified of Jesus and helps believers to witness of Him. In life, each of us has an opportunities to trust Jesus as Lord and Savior. Maybe someone spoke bad things about Jesus earlier. He forgives them when they trust in Him. After death a person who has rejected the conviction of the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.)

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

What I believe about Jesus makes me either a good or bad tree. What I believe in my heart about Jesus will be visible through my words. When I believe in Jesus can I say bad things about another person? Can I tell a lie? Can I answer people rudely or impatiently? When I believe in Jesus I am like the good tree that brings good fruit. I remember the fruit of the Holy Spirit (Gal 2:22-23).\n  When I trust Jesus, I don‚Äôt want to say something bad because Jesus‚Äô love is in my heart. I love God and others and I can express this love in words sometimes. In the passage, people rudely accused Jesus saying that He drove out demons with demonic power. They were showing with their words that they didn‚Äôt trust Jesus. I can tell people what I believe about Jesus. I can tell them that He is great and greater than all. I can tell them about Jesus‚Äô love and also show them the love of Jesus with my actions. Just as a tree brings forth fruit, so my life can bring God‚Äôs love to people. Jesus, help me to trust You and show people that You are greater than all.\n  Jesus came to the Jews but many of them didn‚Äôt receive Him even though He was their long-awaited Savior of whom the Law and Prophets spoke. Jesus is the Saviour of All who trust in Him. This is why Jesus gave the example of Gentiles who repented and sought God. The Ninevites at the time of Jonah responded to the call to repentance and humbled themselves before God. Jesus called the Jews to repentance but some of them didn‚Äôt want to repent. During Solomon‚Äôs time, the Queen of Sheba came from afar to see the king‚Äôs glory and seek his wisdom. People stood before Jesus and didn‚Äôt want to repent of their sins and didn‚Äôt want to hear the wisdom of Jesus, the King of the Universe. Today also, Jesus is greater than the prophet Jonah. He calls me and others to repentance. Do I want to come to Jesus to be justified, forgiven and sanctified? Today, Jesus is greater than Solomon. Jesus is a Glorious King who has all wisdom. Do I want to come to Jesus and become a part of His kingdom and receive wisdom from Him?\n  (to better understand Matt. 12:32, see John 15:26, 16:8-15 and Acts 1:8. The Holy Spirit testified of Jesus and helps believers to witness of Him. In life, each of us has an opportunities to trust Jesus as Lord and Savior. Maybe someone spoke bad things about Jesus earlier. He forgives them when they trust in Him. After death a person who has rejected the conviction of the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven.)\n"}</script></div>
