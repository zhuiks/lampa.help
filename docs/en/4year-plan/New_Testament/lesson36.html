		<p>In Matt. 16:13-28, Jesus asked the disciples who they say He is. Peter correctly said that Jesus is the Son of God. Jesus told the disciples how He would soon be killed in Jerusalem and on the third day, rise. Peter didn‚Äôt agree and Jesus said ‚ÄùGet behind Me, Satan!

Moses and Elijah appeared and talked with Him. The disciples heard a voice from heaven saying, ‚ÄúThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!‚Äù (v. 5) They were afraid. They asked Jesus about the prophecy which says that Elijah should come first. Jesus answered that Elijah would and has come. They understood that Jesus was speaking of John the Baptist.</p><p>In verses 14-21, the disciples couldn‚Äôt heal a boy, but Jesus healed him. They asked why they couldn‚Äôt heal him. Jesus said, ‚ÄúBecause of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‚ÄòMove from here to there,‚Äô and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.‚Äù (20-21)</p><p>In verses 22-23 Jesus again spoke of His death and resurrection on the third day.</p><p>In verses 24-27, people asked Jesus to pay the temple tax.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus told the disciples in advance about His death and resurrection. He knew that He came to the world to give His life, to pay for my sin and the sin of all people. His transfiguration on the mountain and conversation with Moses and Elijah show me that Jesus is the Son of God, that He is eternal and that He fulfills the words of the Law (given by God through Moses) and prophecy (which Elijah represented). God‚Äôs plan to save humanity was from eternity. It was always His plan for me to know Him as my God and Savior. I want to tell everyone that Jesus is the Son of God who died for our sin and rose on the third day to forgive us and give us life in the knowledge of Him. I trust Jesus.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
