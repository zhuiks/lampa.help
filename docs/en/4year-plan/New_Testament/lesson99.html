	Summary
</h3>
		<p>7 bowls of God‚Äôs wrath. A voice from the heavenly temple told the angels to pour out God‚Äôs wrath on the earth. The angels said that God is just and His judgement is righteous. People didn‚Äôt repent when God judged them (16:9 and 11). People on earth gathered at Armegeddon. When the angel poured out the 7th bowl on the earth, he said, ‚Äúit is finished.‚Äù John said how God judged and conquered those who didn‚Äôt believe in Jesus. ‚ÄúThey will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with Him are called and chosen and faithful.‚Äú (17:14). God brought an end to all the evil earthly kingdoms and judged them. ‚ÄúRejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her (Babylon)!‚Äú (18:20). In heaven, a great multitude of people said: ‚ÄúHallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, 2  for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.‚Äú (19:1-2). The people in heaven rejoiced that the time had come for the wedding feast of the Lamb.</p><p>John saw how Jesus came on a white horse. He is King, He is Faithful and True. He is King of kings and Lord of lords. He is the Word of God. Jesus judged and conquered all His enemies (including the Beast and the false prophet). An angel locked up the dragon (Satan) for 1,000 years in a bottomless pit so that he would not deceive people. Jesus reigned on earth for 1,000 years with the saints whom He resurrected. At the end of the 1,000 years, Satan was freed and deceived the nations. The nations warred against Jesus and wanted to win, but God saved His own and Satan was thrown into the lake of fire. John saw the Great White Throne and all the dead stood to be judged before God. If their name was not in the Lamb‚Äôs book of life, the person was thrown into the lake of fire. Death and hell were also thrown into the lake of fire.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I believe that earthly kingdoms will come to an end, but the Heavenly Kingdom is eternal. I understand that God judges those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus and they will be eternally punished. Jesus is coming and will conquer! Believers will rule with Him in His Kingdom. Now, it seems like Satan and evil people are winning but the Bible teaches me that they will lose. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you Jesus that you have the victory! Thank you that my name is written in Your book of life because You have redeemed me and I belong to You. I want to be Your witness, so that people would know that You are King of kings and Lord of lords. Thank you for the living hope that I will be with You in Your glory forever. Help me to live in expectation of your return and tell people about salvation in You. </em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
