	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus heard that His friend Lazarus was sick and died. Jesus purposely didn‚Äôt come to Lazarus before he died because his sickness was for the glory of God (v. 4). Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha. Martha believed in Jesus and knew that He could do anything but she didn‚Äôt know if it was God‚Äôs will to raise Lazarus from the dead. Jesus told her that He is the Resurrection and the Life. Many people were with Mary and Martha to comfort them. Mary came to Jesus and said that Jesus could have prevented her brother‚Äôs death. Jesus saw how the sisters and others were crying about Lazarus‚Äôs death. He also cried (v. 35). Jesus went to the grave where Lazarus lay and asked them to remove the stone. Martha warned that there would be a bad smell because Lazarus had already been dead for 4 days. ‚ÄúJesus said to her, ‚ÄúDid I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?‚Äù (v.40). Jesus said in a loud voice ‚ÄúLazarus, come out!‚Äù (v.43) and Lazarus come out of the grave! Many people saw this miracle.</p><p></p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. He Himself rose from the dead. He also promises to raise me up after death (if I die before His Second Coming). This is why He said to Martha, ‚ÄúI am the Resurrection and the Life, he who believes in me though he may die, he shall live.‚Äù When believers in Jesus die, they have a hope that they will live again with Jesus in His Eternal Kingdom. If I have a friend or a relative who died, knowing Jesus, I will see them again. Jesus will raise up all people. Those who believe in Him will live forever, happy in paradise. Those who don‚Äôt believe in Him will be forever tormented in hell. This is why it is important to believe in Jesus! This is why it is important to tell people that Jesus gives eternal life. I don‚Äôt want to go to hell and don‚Äôt want anyone else to go there either.
		
	</p><p>Also, in this story, I see that Jesus loved His friends and He was sad when they were having a hard time. He sees how the world has sin, sickness and death and how people suffer from this. He came to earth to conquer sin and death. Today, people still die but through faith in Jesus, there is the hope of resurrection and eternal life. I don‚Äôt have to fear death because for believers in Jesus, death is just crossing over into God‚Äôs presence.
		
	</p><p>Just like with Lazarus, sometimes Jesus decides not to heal someone now and allows them to die. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that He doesn‚Äôt love the person. Believers will be with Jesus after death and Jesus in His wisdom knows when to take someone to be with Him in heaven. I can trust Jesus and know that He is wise and has good plans for me and other believers.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
