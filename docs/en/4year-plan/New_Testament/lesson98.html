	Summary
</h3>
		<p>John saw heaven and the throne of God. Everything glorifies God. Only Jesus is worthy to open the scroll with 7 seals because He overcame. He is the Lamb of God. In heaven, people from every tribe, language, people and nation will worship and praise God. Jesus made believers king and priests of God: they will reign on earth (5:10).</p><p></p><p>The 7 seals: In chapter 6, Jesus began to open the seals one by one and with each one, plagues happened on earth. John saw 144,000 sons of Israel that were sealed and many people from every tribe, language, people and nation. He saw those who died for their faith in Jesus who were in His presence and, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the Lamb who is at the center of the throne will shepherd them;He will guide them to springs of living waters, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.‚Äú (7:17). When Jesus opened the 7th seal, there was 30 minutes of silence in heaven.</p><p></p><p>The 7 trumpets: The angels blew the trumpets and plagues started to happen on earth. Many people died from sores and those who didn‚Äôt still refused to repent from their sin (9:20). In Ch. 10, John saw a strong angel with an open book which God told John to eat in order to further prophesy to people. God said that His 2 witnesses would prophesy for 3 ¬Ω years until the Beast kills them. But after 3 ¬Ω days they will be resurrected and go up into heaven.</p><p>When the angel blows the 7th trumpet, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ there were loud voices in heaven saying: The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Messiah, and He will reign forever and ever!‚Äú (11:15). People around the throne of God said, ‚ÄúThe nations were angry, but Your wrath has come. The time has come for the dead to be judged and to give the reward to Your servants the prophets, to the saints, and to those who fear Your name, both small and great, and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth.‚Äú (11:18).</p><p>John saw a vision of a woman and a dragon and a war in heaven that showed how satan warred against God and believers in Jesus and could not prevail. The Dragon (Satan) gave authority to the Beast whom non-believers worshiped. He ruled for 3 ¬Ω years and killed believers in Jesus (13:7). ‚ÄúIf anyone is destined for captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone is to be killed with a sword, with a sword he will be killed. This demands the perseverance and faith of the saints.‚Äú (13:10). Another beast appeared who deceived people with miracles and told people to worship the first beast. He put a mark on people so that only those with the mark could buy and sell.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 14: John saw the Lamb (Jesus) on Mount Zion with the 144,000 sons of Israel. Then he saw, ‚Äú‚Ä¶another angel flying high overhead, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth‚Äîto every nation, tribe, language, and people. 7 He spoke with a loud voice: ‚ÄúFear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.‚Äú (14:6-7). Another angel declared God‚Äôs victory and His punishment of non-believers. ‚ÄúThis demands the perseverance of the saints, who keep God‚Äôs commands and their faith in Jesus.‚Äù 13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, ‚ÄúWrite: The dead who die in the Lord from now on are blessed.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù says the Spirit, ‚Äúlet them rest from their labors, for their works follow them!‚Äú (14:12-13).</p><p>Then he saw how the angels in heaven began to harvest the earth with a sickle and throw grapes into the great winepress of God‚Äôs wrath. Those who overcame the beast sang to Jesus, ‚ÄúGreat and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the Nations.4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, for all the nations will come and worship before You because Your righteous acts have been revealed.‚Äù (15:3-4).</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus is worthy of worship. I worship Him alone. My prayers are like a pleasing fragrance before God (5:8). I believe that Jesus rules over all. Now I see those who don‚Äôt love Jesus and are doing evil. The Bible teaches me that Jesus will punish sin and destroy those who rebel on this fallen world. He wants me to trust Him and worship Him alone. Only He is worthy because He conquered sin and death on the cross and shed His blood to redeem me. Believers die for their faith in Jesus but a great reward awaits those who endure and remain faithful to Him. Jesus is always with me and He is my help.
		
	</p><p>Now there is time for non-believers to repent and come to Jesus. I don‚Äôt want unbelievers to experience the wrath of God. Believers receive salvation and not wrath as it says, ‚ÄúFor God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, ‚Äú (1 Thess. 5:9). 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to trust You, follow You and tell people about salvation in You. You are the Great Savior. You conquered. Thank you that you redeemed me and I belong to You and will be with You in Your eternal kingdom. All honor and glory to You forever.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Then he saw, ‚Äú‚Ä¶another angel flying high overhead, having the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth‚Äîto every nation, tribe, language, and people. 7 He spoke with a loud voice: ‚ÄúFear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgment has come. Worship the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.‚Äú (14:6-7). Another angel declared God‚Äôs victory and His punishment of non-believers. ‚ÄúThis demands the perseverance of the saints, who keep God‚Äôs commands and their faith in Jesus.‚Äù 13 Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, ‚ÄúWrite: The dead who die in the Lord from now on are blessed.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù says the Spirit, ‚Äúlet them rest from their labors, for their works follow them!‚Äú (14:12-13).\n  Then he saw how the angels in heaven began to harvest the earth with a sickle and throw grapes into the great winepress of God‚Äôs wrath. Those who overcame the beast sang to Jesus, ‚ÄúGreat and awe-inspiring are Your works, Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are Your ways, King of the Nations.4 Lord, who will not fear and glorify Your name? Because You alone are holy, for all the nations will come and worship before You because Your righteous acts have been revealed.‚Äù (15:3-4).\nCharacter:\n- Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and it to come\n- 'The Lord is worthy to receive glory and honor and strength: for He has created\n  all things and because of His will they exist and were created'\n- He lives forever\n- Jesus is the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David and He conquered\n- Jesus redeemed people from every tribe, language, people and nation with His blood\n- He is the Lord who is Holy and True, who judges and avenges those who dwell on earth\n  for the blood of His saints the was shed (6:10)\n- Salvation belongs to God, who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb\n- God is Judge\n- Jesus is the Victor\n- He is the Lamb of God\nApplication: |\n  Jesus is worthy of worship. I worship Him alone. My prayers are like a pleasing fragrance before God (5:8). I believe that Jesus rules over all. Now I see those who don‚Äôt love Jesus and are doing evil. The Bible teaches me that Jesus will punish sin and destroy those who rebel on this fallen world. He wants me to trust Him and worship Him alone. Only He is worthy because He conquered sin and death on the cross and shed His blood to redeem me. Believers die for their faith in Jesus but a great reward awaits those who endure and remain faithful to Him. Jesus is always with me and He is my help.\n  Now there is time for non-believers to repent and come to Jesus. I don‚Äôt want unbelievers to experience the wrath of God. Believers receive salvation and not wrath as it says, ‚ÄúFor God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, ‚Äú (1 Thess. 5:9). __Jesus, help me to trust You, follow You and tell people about salvation in You. You are the Great Savior. You conquered. Thank you that you redeemed me and I belong to You and will be with You in Your eternal kingdom. All honor and glory to You forever.__\n"}</script></div>
