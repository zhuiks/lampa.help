	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul writes that the God of all comforts, comforts believers in their sufferings so that they can comfort other believers. (1:3-4) He told the church to forgive and love the repentant person who had sinned earlier. (2:7-8) God enables believers to live for Him and share the gospel. ‚Äú Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. 18 But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.‚Äù (3:17-18) We preach Christ. People in the world are blind and can‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù Jesus, but God can open their eyes, that they would see Jesus‚Äô glory. (4:6) We are weak vessels but the Holy Spirit is within us. ‚Äú Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 18 while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.‚Äù (4:16-18)</p><p>Our bodies are temporal now but God is preparing a dwelling for us in heaven. (5:1) One day, believers will be with Him. We want to tell others about Jesus. ‚Äú For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; 15 and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.‚Äù (5:14-15) Believers are a new creation. (5:17)</p><p>Believers have the ministry of reconciliation which means sharing with people about Jesus. ‚ÄúFor He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.‚Äù (5:21) Paul writes that believers are the temple of the living God and shouldn‚Äôt ‚ÄúDo not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion has light with darkness?‚Äù (6:14)</p><p>In the first letter to the Corinthians, Paul corrected the believers there. They were sad and repented. ‚ÄúFor godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.‚Äù (7:10) Titus was in Corinth and told Paul how the church there obeyed his correction. Paul was very glad that they humbled themselves before God.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>When I‚Äôm having a hard time, I know that Jesus is with me. He Himself suffered and understands when I suffer. He comforts me and then I can comfort others when they suffer. Earlier, Paul had written the church so that they wouldn‚Äôt  have close fellowship with people who called themselves believers but were really living a sinful lifestyle. According to Paul‚Äôs words in this letter, I understand that this person repented. Paul writes that the church should love and forgive this person. I should do the same. Jesus changes me so that I would become more like HIm. Thank you, Jesus, for Your work in my life and the lives of other believers. Thank you, that I am a new creation in Jesus. When a person sincerely trusts Jesus, God changes him. Do I see that God has changed my heart? Do I want God to change my heart, so that I would become more like Jesus? I can ask Him and He will work in my heart by the Holy Spirit.
		
	</p><p>I am a weak vessel, but Jesus can use my life, so that people would be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. I can be Jesus‚Äô ambassador. I want to show people that Jesus is Savior. Jesus‚Äô love towards me gives me the desire to tell others about Jesus. Maybe here on earth I will suffer for my faith in Jesus. Paul and the other apostles experienced a lot for the sake of the gospel. But I am sure that this present suffering is nothing compared to the glory that I will see when I am with Jesus in heaven. He promised me that I will be with Him forever in heaven and I want others to be with Jesus too.
		
	</p><p>When I sin and God convicts me, I want to repent quickly and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Jesus, help me to sincerely grieve over my sin and fully submit to You. Thank you for Your grace and salvation.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

He Himself suffered and understands when I suffer. He comforts me and then I can comfort others when they suffer. Earlier, Paul had written the church so that they wouldn‚Äôt  have close fellowship with people who called themselves believers but were really living a sinful lifestyle. According to Paul‚Äôs words in this letter, I understand that this person repented. Paul writes that the church should love and forgive this person. I should do the same. Jesus changes me so that I would become more like HIm. Thank you, Jesus, for Your work in my life and the lives of other believers. Thank you, that I am a new creation in Jesus. When a person sincerely trusts Jesus, God changes him. Do I see that God has changed my heart? Do I want God to change my heart, so that I would become more like Jesus? I can ask Him and He will work in my heart by the Holy Spirit.\n  I am a weak vessel, but Jesus can use my life, so that people would be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. I can be Jesus‚Äô ambassador. I want to show people that Jesus is Savior. Jesus‚Äô love towards me gives me the desire to tell others about Jesus. Maybe here on earth I will suffer for my faith in Jesus. Paul and the other apostles experienced a lot for the sake of the gospel. But I am sure that this present suffering is nothing compared to the glory that I will see when I am with Jesus in heaven. He promised me that I will be with Him forever in heaven and I want others to be with Jesus too.\n  When I sin and God convicts me, I want to repent quickly and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Jesus, help me to sincerely grieve over my sin and fully submit to You. Thank you for Your grace and salvation.\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script></div>
