	Summary
</h3>
		<p>1 Timothy </p><p>You may read about Timothy in Acts 16:1, 17:4, 18:5, 19:22, 20:4, Rom. 16:21, 1 Cor. 4:17, Phil. 1:1, 2:19, 22, 1 Thess. 3:2, 6 and Heb. 13:23. He traveled with Paul and other believers to share about Jesus and teach the church.</p><p></p><p>1 Tim.1: Paul wanted Timothy to be in Ephesus and charged people to not spread false teaching.</p><p>1 Tim. 2: He wrote that it‚Äôs important to pray for all, that women should dress modestly and have self-control, showing their love for Jesus through their deeds.</p><p>1 Tim. 3: Paul describes the characteristics of a church leader. ‚ÄúGreat indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness:He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations,believed on in the world, taken up in glory.‚Äù (1 Tim. 3:16)</p><p>1 Tim. 4: Paul wanted Timothy to hold on to the truth about Jesus and teach it to others.</p><p>1 Tim. 5: He wrote about how people in church should treat one another. ‚ÄúThe sins of some people are conspicuous, going before them to judgement, but the sins of others appear later. 25 So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.‚Äú (1 Tim. 5:24-25).</p><p>1 Tim. 6: ‚ÄúBut godliness with contentment is great gain, 7 for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. 8 But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content‚Äú (1 Tim. 6:6-8). Paul again warns about false teachings and wrong attitudes towards money. ‚ÄúBut as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. 12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses‚Äú (1 Tim. 6:11-12). ‚Äú As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.‚Äú (1 Tim. 6:17).</p><p></p><p>Titus </p><p>You may read about Titus in 2 Cor. 7:6, 13-14, 8:16, 23; Gal. 2:1. He traveled with Paul and other believers just like Timothy. He taught and served in Corinth. Paul wrote him when Titus was in Crete (Titus 1:5).</p><p></p><p>Titus 1: Paul wanted Titus to set up church leaders. He wrote, so Titus would know what a church leader‚Äôs character should be like. ‚ÄúFor an overseer, as God‚Äôs steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 9 He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.‚Äú (Titus 1:7-9).</p><p>Titus 2: Paul wrote that it‚Äôs important to teach the truth and not false teaching. Believers of all ages should love Jesus and live in purity. ‚ÄúFor the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.‚Äú (Titus 2:11-14).</p><p>Titus 3: ‚ÄúBut when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life‚Äú (Titus 3:4-7). Now believers have new life through faith in Jesus and do good works.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus is the head of the church and He wants leaders in the church to love Him and follow Him. What characteristics of a leader are described in 1 Timothy and Titus? How can I have these characteristics? Only Jesus can change my heart and help me to be honest, loving and humble. Because Jesus saved me, I want to love God and others through good works. My works don‚Äôt save me. Only God‚Äôs grace and mercy save me. I want to express my love for God to people with my life.
		
	</p><p>Paul often warned about false teachings. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to hold on to the words of the BIble and to correctly understand that You save by grace and change my heart. Help me to discern when I hear wrong teaching and to remember what the Bible teaches and pass on the truth to others. Guard me from deception, Jesus. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit and show me how to live for You and love others. When they see my good works, I want them to praise You, Jesus.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

He wrote, so Titus would know what a church leader‚Äôs character should be like. ‚ÄúFor an overseer, as God‚Äôs steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, 8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. 9 He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.‚Äú (Titus 1:7-9).\n  Titus 2: Paul wrote that it‚Äôs important to teach the truth and not false teaching. Believers of all ages should love Jesus and live in purity. ‚ÄúFor the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.‚Äú (Titus 2:11-14).\n  Titus 3: ‚ÄúBut when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, 5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, 7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life‚Äú (Titus 3:4-7). Now believers have new life through faith in Jesus and do good works.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Savior\n- God can never lie\n- He saved us according to His mercy and justified us by grace\n- He gives true eternal life\n- Jesus is the KIng Eternal, immortal, invisible and God only wise\n- He is worthy of honor and eternal glory\n- Jesus saved believers, cleansed them and gives them His Holy Spirit (Titus 3:4-8)\nApplication: |\n  Jesus is the head of the church and He wants leaders in the church to love Him and follow Him. What characteristics of a leader are described in 1 Timothy and Titus? How can I have these characteristics? Only Jesus can change my heart and help me to be honest, loving and humble. Because Jesus saved me, I want to love God and others through good works. My works don‚Äôt save me. Only God‚Äôs grace and mercy save me. I want to express my love for God to people with my life.\n  Paul often warned about false teachings. __Jesus, help me to hold on to the words of the BIble and to correctly understand that You save by grace and change my heart. Help me to discern when I hear wrong teaching and to remember what the Bible teaches and pass on the truth to others. Guard me from deception, Jesus. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit and show me how to live for You and love others. When they see my good works, I want them to praise You, Jesus.__\n\n  *Teacher!
