	Summary
</h3>
		<p>In verses 1-11, Ananias and Sapphira gave the impression that they had given all their money to the church (the group of believers) after selling their land. But the Holy Spirit showed Peter that they acted dishonestly. Ananias and Sapphira lied to God and the Lord took their lives. All the people who heard were scared.</p><p>In verses 12-16 God healed many people through the apostles. Believers gathered near the temple and new people joined them and believed in the Lord Jesus.</p><p>In verses 17-42 Some of the temple leaders didn‚Äôt believe in Jesus and were envious of the apostles and put them in prison. But God sent an angel at night to open the prison door and tell them, ‚ÄúGo, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life.‚Äù (v. 20) They went to the temple and started teaching people about Jesus. When the leaders sent for them in prison, the apostles weren‚Äôt there, although the doors were locked! They found them in the temple and took them again. Peter shared about Jesus with them but they wanted to kill them. However, one wise teacher said that if their teaching was from God, then is wasn‚Äôt worth it to stand against them but if it wasn‚Äôt from God, that in time, it would all come to an end. Then the leaders ordered that the apostles be beaten and let them go, forbidding them to teach people about Jesus. ‚ÄúSo they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His  name. 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.‚Äù (v. 41-42)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Ananias and Sapphira wanted to hide the truth and give the impression that they were generous. God showed everyone that it is impossible to trick God. God knows everything that I do. I don‚Äôt want to hide anything from God. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to be honest.</em>
	</p><p>The believers gathers in a place where everyone could see them and join them, so that they could be healed, hear about Jesus and fellowship with believers. I don‚Äôt want to hide my faith in Jesus but I want to fellowship with people about Him, so that they would also be joined to the Lord.
		
	</p><p>The leaders put believers in prison because of envy! They wanted people to respect them and didn‚Äôt want Jesus to be glorified. They wanted to stop the work of God, but they couldn‚Äôt. Maybe the apostles were afraid when they were in prison but God was with them and helped them. When the angel freed them, they didn‚Äôt run home to hide. They were obedient to God and went to the temple to teach about Jesus. The Holy Spirit gave them boldness and wisdom. When people threaten me for my faith in Jesus, I can ask for help knowing that the Holy Spirit (God) will give me the necessary words and guide me. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to share with people about You. Fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to not fear people but to respect and love You more than everything and everyone!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
