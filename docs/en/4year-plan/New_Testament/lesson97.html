		<p>Ch. 1: The purpose and promise of the book, “The revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave Him to show His slaves what must quickly take place. He sent it and signified it through His angel to His slave John, 2 who testified to God’s word and to the testimony about Jesus Christ, in all he saw. 3 The one who reads this is blessed, and those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep what is written in it are blessed, because the time is near!“ (1:1-3)</p><p>John saw a vision of Jesus. Jesus told him, “write what you have seen, what is, and what will take place after this.” (1:19).</p><p>Ch. 2 &amp; 3:</p><p>In the letter to the church of Ephesus, Jesus said that they had correctly held on to the truth and endured for His name’s sake, but that they had left their first love. He said, “Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. Otherwise, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent,” and “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in God’s paradise.” (2:5 and 7).</p><p></p><p>In the letter to the church of Smyrna, Jesus told them to not fear that they would endure suffering for their faith. “Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer…Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. 11 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The victor will never be harmed by the second death“ (2:10-11).</p><p></p><p>In the letter to the church of Pergamum, Jesus said that they should repent of their sin. “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. I will give the victor some of the hidden manna.I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.“ (2:17).</p><p></p><p>In the letter to the church of Thyatira, Jesus said that, “I know your works—your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance. Your last works are greater than the first.“ (2:19). He wanted them to hold on to the truth until He came. “The one who is victorious and keeps My works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations—27 and he will shepherd them with an iron scepter; he will shatter them like pottery, just as I have received this from My Father. 28 I will also give him the morning star.“ (2:26-28).</p><p></p><p>In the letter to the church of Sardis, Jesus said that they are dead and should repent and wake up. “In the same way, the victor will be dressed in white clothes, and I will never erase his name from the book of life but will acknowledge his name before My Father and before His angels.6 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:5-6).</p><p></p><p>In the letter to the church of Philadelphia, Jesus said, “ I know your works. Because you have limited strength, have kept My word, and have not denied My name, look, I have placed before you an open door that no one is able to close.“ (3:8). “The victor: I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God—the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from My God—and My new name. 13 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:12-13).</p><p></p><p>In the letter to the church of Laodicea, Jesus said that they were neither hot nor cold and that he would vomit them out of His mouth. He called them to come to Him and to repent: “ Listen! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and have dinner with him, and he with Me.” (3:20). “The victor: I will give him the right to sit with Me on My throne, just as I also won the victory and sat down with My Father on His throne.22 “Anyone who has an ear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.“ (3:21-22).</p><p></p></section>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
