	Summary
</h3>
		<p>In chapters 21 and 22, Jesus gave John a vision of what will happen in the future. He wrote, ‚ÄúNow I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, ‚ÄúBehold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.‚Äù Then He who sat on the throne said, ‚ÄúBehold, I make all things new.‚Äù And He said to me, ‚ÄúWrite, for these words are true and faithful‚Äù (21:1-5).</p><p>They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.‚Äù (22:4-5) Jesus says several times that He is coming soon! Believers answer that they want Jesus to come and also want people to come to Jesus for the gift of new life. (22:17)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God has a great plan of salvation. He wants people to be with Him. Without Jesus, everyone is separated from Him because of sin. But all can receive forgiveness through faith in Jesus. I and everyone that trusts in Jesus can be with God forever. This is good news! Do I believe in Jesus? Do I understand the salvation He offers? If I trust Him, then right now Jesus lives in my heart and His Holy Spirit is in me. But one day, Jesus will come and take me to be with Him.
		
	</p><p>He will make a new heaven and new earth. There, I will live with Jesus forever! In that place, there will be no sin, pain or suffering. There in heaven, also called the New Jerusalem, I will see Jesus face to face! I want everyone to be there with Jesus. That‚Äôs why I want to tell people about Him. Now, people can be saved by Jesus‚Äô grace through faith in Him. But there will be a time when it will already be too late and Jesus will judge those who didn‚Äôt believe in Him and punish them in hell. Jesus gives rewards to those to believe in Him.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, I don‚Äôt want people to go to hell. I want them to be with You in heaven. Save people, Jesus, and help me to tell people about salvation in You and about the hope of heaven, where You will reign. Help me to warn people about hell so they will quickly turn to the Saviour for mercy and forgiveness. Jesus, I am waiting for You! You are coming soon! I will be very glad to see You! You are my King and Saviour! I love you. Thank you for Your Great Love!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
