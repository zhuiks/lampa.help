		<p>“My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, 3 knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. 4 But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (James 1:2-5)</p><p></p><p>“Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. 13 Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone” (James 1:12-13)</p><p></p><p>“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.” (James 1:17)</p><p></p><p>“So then, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; 20 for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.” (James 1:19-20)</p><p></p><p>“ But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.” (James 1:22)</p><p></p><p>“Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” (James 1:27)</p><p></p><p>“My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality.“ (James 2:1)</p><p></p><p>“If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you do well” (James 2:8)</p><p></p><p>“For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all” (James 2: 10)</p><p></p><p>“For judgment is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.” (James 2:13)</p><p>“Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? 23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.And he was called the friend of God.” (James 2:22-23)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I believe in Jesus and know that I will have trials that strengthen my faith in Jesus. God will help me and promises to give me wisdom and strength in every situation. God doesn’t tempt me but He sometimes tests me so that I would trust Him more and rely upon Him. God always has good intentions for my life. Jesus gives me wisdom to know how to live and follow Him. He helps me to listen to others and know what to say and not get angry. He gives me love for others and shows me how to fulfill what His Word says (for example to help widows and orphans and to live a pure life).
		
	</p><p>I know that we people are all the same before God. That is, Jesus died for the poor and the rich and sees everyone the same. I also should treat all people with the same love and respect. I shouldn’t judge others or discriminate against them because I myself am imperfect. Only Jesus is perfect. By His mercy, Jesus paid for my sin and this is why “mercy triumphs over judgment.” When I believe in something or someone, my belief is manifested through what I do. Abraham and Rahab believed in God and I see their faith through what they did. My actions don’t save me. Only the perfect life of Jesus and His sacrifice on the cross saves me when I believe in Him and start to trust Him. Now because of my faith in Jesus, I want to live pleasing Him. He gives me strength and wisdom through the Holy Spirit and the Word to daily follow Him. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please give me wisdom and love to endure trials, to be strengthened in faith and to love everyone as You love, through my life (in all that I do.)</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Хронологические планы уроков, обучающие видео для детского служения, идеи для изучения золотых стихов, идеи поделок и детские Библейские песни.\n\nabout = \n  Когда мы помогали в новой церкви в Средней Азии, наш пастор попросил команду детского служения разработать хронологическую Библейскую программу, которая была бы сосредоточена на том, как Христос виден в во всем Писании. Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
