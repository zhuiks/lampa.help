	Summary
</h3>
		<p>In chapter 3, Peter and John went to the temple to pray and saw a man who was crippled from birth begging for money near the gate. “Then Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” (verse 6). They helped him to stand on his feet and he started to walk and praise God. Everyone saw that the man who couldn’t walk before was healed. Peter preached to the people about Jesus and said that Jesus healed the man and that He died, rose again and forgives the sins of those who believe in Him (verse 19).</p><p></p><p>In chapter 4, the priests and other leaders didn’t like it that Peter and John were talking about Jesus and the resurrection. They put them in prison. But many people heard about Jesus and around 5,000 people believed! In the morning, Peter and John answered that Jesus healed the man and that “… there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved”(v. 12). The leaders forbid them to speak about Jesus, “But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” (v. 19-20). The leaders let them go and the believers gathered to pray that God would continue to give them boldness “and when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.” (v. 31)</p></section>

		<p>Peter and John saw the man in need on their way to prayer. They gave the man what they could: the good news about Jesus! Jesus can help people. When I see people’s needs, I can tell them that Jesus can help them. A crowd of people saw how the crippled man was healed. Peter and John didn’t want glory for themselves but told everyone that Jesus healed him. They told them about salvation in Jesus. 5,000 people believed because they told the truth (Acts 4:4). I want to give the glory to Jesus when He does something good in my life and the lives of others. I want to tell the truth about Jesus so that people would believe in Him.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Хронологические планы уроков, обучающие видео для детского служения, идеи для изучения золотых стихов, идеи поделок и детские Библейские песни.\n\nabout = \n  Когда мы помогали в новой церкви в Средней Азии, наш пастор попросил команду детского служения разработать хронологическую Библейскую программу, которая была бы сосредоточена на том, как Христос виден в во всем Писании. Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
