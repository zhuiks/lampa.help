		<p>‚ÄúThen Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.  Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.  And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.  So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him,‚ÄúZacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.‚Äù  So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully.  But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, ‚ÄúHe has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.‚Äù</p><p>Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, ‚ÄúLook, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.‚Äù</p><p>And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúToday salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.‚Äù (Luke 19:1-10)</p><p>‚ÄúAnd He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, 2 and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites. 3 So He said, ‚ÄúTruly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all; 4 for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.‚Äù (Luke 21:1-4)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Zacchaeus was a dishonest person who offended many people. He really wanted to see Jesus. He probably heard that Jesus did many miracles and that people called Him Saviour. Jesus knew Zacchaeus‚Äô name and knew that he was watching Him from the tree. He knew that he had stolen money from people. Jesus wanted to be with Zacchaeus and change his life. Jesus sought to spend time with a person that everyone in the town hated. Jesus loved him and wanted to save him. Zacchaeus really changed after spending time (fellowshipping) with Jesus. He became honest and generous,  not selfish, after he experienced Jesus‚Äô love.
		
	</p><p>Zacchaeus was looking for Jesus when he climbed the tree, but Jesus was looking for him! Jesus knew his heart and He knows my heart. He knows my sins and how I can be greedy or selfish. He knows my name. He wants to spend time with me. At any time or any place, I can talk with (fellowship) with Him and not only when I pray, read the Bible or sing worship songs! When I fellowship with Jesus, He changes me! I experience His love and care and He gives me love for others. He fills me with the Holy Spirit and gives me a new heart that loves God and others.
		
	</p><p>Maybe other people see that I fellowship with Jesus and they don‚Äôt like it. God‚Äôs opinion is most important and not the opinion of people. It‚Äôs important to know that Jesus loves me and to love Him. I want to tell people about Jesus so they would believe in Him and that He would change their lives. Only Jesus can change a person‚Äôs heart. I want to pray for ____________, that like Zacchaeus, they would know Jesus and that God would change him/her just like He changed Zacchaeus. I want to be loving and generous like Jesus and like Zacchaeus. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to love like You love. Thank you for seeking me, finding me and saving me. Thank you that you change my heart and my life!</em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Luke 21:1-4: In this passage, people gave gifts to God. They wanted to say that all that they had was really from God and that we give Him what already belongs to Him. They said thank you to Him for providing for them. Jesus saw that some people gave money but they didn‚Äôt really think that all that they had was God‚Äôs and belongs to Him. But God, Jesus, saw the poor widow and said that even though she didn‚Äôt give much money, she actually gave more than the others because she gave out of her poverty and understood that all she had came from God and belongs to Him. She is a good example for me. I know that all I have is from God. I want to use everything for His glory. It‚Äôs not right to think that only a part of what I have belongs to God.
		
	</p><p>Jesus, please show me how to use what You have given me. My toys, money, clothes, home, time, strength and life is all from God. Jesus, show me how I can praise and thank You for all that You give. Maybe I can give some of my toys to someone. Maybe I can give some of my clothes to an orphanage. I want to have a thankful heart like that widow who trusted God with everything that she had. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, You gave all for me. You gave Your life for me. Thank you for Your love and care. Jesus, help me to see that everything is from You and help me to say thank you for everything and have a thankful heart.</em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>*We can compare Zacchaeus‚Äô attitude towards money with that of the widow‚Äôs. When I trust God in everything, He helps me to be generous and giving. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, give me a heart that trusts You and uses everything You give for Your glory.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>

He fills me with the Holy Spirit and gives me a new heart that loves God and others.\n  Maybe other people see that I fellowship with Jesus and they don‚Äôt like it. God‚Äôs opinion is most important and not the opinion of people. It‚Äôs important to know that Jesus loves me and to love Him. I want to tell people about Jesus so they would believe in Him and that He would change their lives. Only Jesus can change a person‚Äôs heart. I want to pray for ____________, that like Zacchaeus, they would know Jesus and that God would change him/her just like He changed Zacchaeus. I want to be loving and generous like Jesus and like Zacchaeus. __Jesus, help me to love like You love. Thank you for seeking me, finding me and saving me. Thank you that you change my heart and my life!__\n\n  Luke 21:1-4: In this passage, people gave gifts to God. They wanted to say that all that they had was really from God and that we give Him what already belongs to Him. They said thank you to Him for providing for them. Jesus saw that some people gave money but they didn‚Äôt really think that all that they had was God‚Äôs and belongs to Him. But God, Jesus, saw the poor widow and said that even though she didn‚Äôt give much money, she actually gave more than the others because she gave out of her poverty and understood that all she had came from God and belongs to Him. She is a good example for me. I know that all I have is from God. I want to use everything for His glory. It‚Äôs not right to think that only a part of what I have belongs to God.\n  Jesus, please show me how to use what You have given me. My toys, money, clothes, home, time, strength and life is all from God. Jesus, show me how I can praise and thank You for all that You give. Maybe I can give some of my toys to someone. Maybe I can give some of my clothes to an orphanage. I want to have a thankful heart like that widow who trusted God with everything that she had. __Jesus, You gave all for me. You gave Your life for me. Thank you for Your love and care. Jesus, help me to see that everything is from You and help me to say thank you for everything and have a thankful heart.__\n\n  *We can compare Zacchaeus‚Äô attitude towards money with that of the widow‚Äôs. When I trust God in everything, He helps me to be generous and giving. __Jesus, give me a heart that trusts You and uses everything You give for Your glory.__\n"}</script></div>
