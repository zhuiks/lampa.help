	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 11: ‚ÄúNow faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof  of what is not seen.‚Äú (11:1)</p><p>‚Äú Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who draws near to Him must believe that He exists and rewards those who seek Him.‚Äú (11:6). Many people lived by faith and in their lives made decisions that showed that God was the most important and that they expected eternal life with God after life on earth (11:10). They lived their lives knowing that things on earth are temporary, ‚Äú But they now desire a better place‚Äîa heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.‚Äú (11:16).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 12: ‚ÄúTherefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us lay aside every weight and the sin that so easily ensnares us. Let us run with endurance the race that lies before us, 2 keeping our eyes on Jesus, the source and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that lay before Him endured a cross and despised the shame and has sat down at the right hand of God‚Äôs throne.‚Äú (12:1-2). God the Father disciplines His own so they will share in His holiness (12:10). His discipline teaches us what is right and results in righteousness. ‚Äú Make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up, causing trouble and by it, defiling many‚Äú (12:15). Believers should remember that they  don‚Äôt come to God through the Law of the old covenant but through the blood of Jesus Christ in the new covenant. People shouldn‚Äôt turn away from God, who speaks to them.  Grace helps believers to serve God. They are thankful that they are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken. (12:28).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 13: Believers live by faith: love one another, care for those who suffer, live in purity and the author wrote: ‚ÄúYour life should be free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for He Himself has said, I will never leave you or forsake you. 6 Therefore, we may boldly say: The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?‚Äú (13:5-6). Believers follow the example of mature believers remembering that, ‚ÄúJesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever‚Äù (13:8). They don‚Äôt listen to false teaching but remember that salvation is by grace. Jesus Himself suffered that believers could be with God. They are ready to suffer for the sake of faith in Jesus, ‚ÄúFor we do not have an enduring city here; instead, we seek the one to come.‚Äú (13:14). ‚ÄúNow may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus‚Äîthe great Shepherd of the sheep‚Äîwith the blood of the everlasting covenant, 21 equip you with all that is good to do His will, working in us what is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ. Glory belongs to Him forever and ever.] Amen.‚Äú (13:20-21).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The Bible is full of vivid examples of people who trusted God with their lives. Their examples help me to understand what ‚Äúfaith‚Äù means. Faith is my trust in Jesus and in what He promises (which is unseen, such as life in heaven or my justification), that is visible in my actions (how I live, what I value and what decisions I make). I believe that Jesus‚Äô blood paid for my sin and that He is coming again and I will live with HIm forever. This is why as I make decisions now, I think about eternity with Jesus. I am not afraid to say that I‚Äôm a believer in Jesus or to act honestly when I know that others will be unhappy. My reward will be in heaven and not now. That which Jesus offers eternally is so much better than what the world offers.
		
	</p><p>__Jesus, help me to remember Your sacrifice and victory for me. Help me to live thinking about eternity and to make decisions that are pleasing to You. Thank You God, that you are a loving, Heavenly Father who disciplines me when I do something wrong in order to correct me and teach me to trust in You, so I can share in Your holiness. You love me so much! I trust that there is always a reason and wisdom in what You do in my life.Thank you that I can be with You in Your kingdom! I know that there will be joy in Your presence. Help me every day to follow You, love You and others and not forget about Your grace. You are my Shepherd and you care for me. Jesus, You perfected my salvation. I love You.__

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Faith is my trust in Jesus and in what He promises (which is unseen, such as life in heaven or my justification), that is visible in my actions (how I live, what I value and what decisions I make). I believe that Jesus‚Äô blood paid for my sin and that He is coming again and I will live with HIm forever. This is why as I make decisions now, I think about eternity with Jesus. I am not afraid to say that I‚Äôm a believer in Jesus or to act honestly when I know that others will be unhappy. My reward will be in heaven and not now. That which Jesus offers eternally is so much better than what the world offers.\n  __Jesus, help me to remember Your sacrifice and victory for me. Help me to live thinking about eternity and to make decisions that are pleasing to You. Thank You God, that you are a loving, Heavenly Father who disciplines me when I do something wrong in order to correct me and teach me to trust in You, so I can share in Your holiness. You love me so much! I trust that there is always a reason and wisdom in what You do in my life.Thank you that I can be with You in Your kingdom! I know that there will be joy in Your presence. Help me every day to follow You, love You and others and not forget about Your grace. You are my Shepherd and you care for me. Jesus, You perfected my salvation. I love You.__\n"}</script></div>
