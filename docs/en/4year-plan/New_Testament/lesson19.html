		<p>Don‚Äôt judge (v. 1-5). Pearl: Don‚Äôt give that which is precious to those who do not value it (v.6).

Salvation and sincere faith: ‚Äú Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.‚Äù (v.12).

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus is sinless and He has the right to judge people because He sees everything correctly. I can‚Äôt judge because I myself am a sinner and can‚Äôt see everything correctly.
		
	</p><p>I need to ask Jesus for wisdom, to know how to share the truth (that is, what is precious) with people. I shouldn‚Äôt throw pearls to the swine because they really will trample them. For example, Jesus didn‚Äôt answer king Herod‚Äôs questions, but was silent because He knew what was in Herod‚Äôs heart. I don‚Äôt know what is in people‚Äôs hearts, but I know that Jesus can show me what to say and how to say it to different people in order to share about salvation through faith in Him. Jesus wants me to share the truth with people but He also wants me to rely upon the leading of the Holy Spirit in how to share.
		
	</p><p>The Heavenly Father wants me to ask of Him, seek His will and knock, coming to be with Him. When I ask of Him, by this I am showing that I trust Him and understand that He is my help. He promises to answer! He hears my prayers. I can find Him. The Bible is full of answers and promises from God.
		
	</p><p>Jesus gave me the ‚Äúgolden rule‚Äù, that is: I should treat others the way that I want them to treat me. I want people to love me just as Jesus loves me. It then follows that I should love them just as Jesus loved them. His love is the best and the strongest. Jesus helps me to love others.
		
	</p><p>There are only 2 paths in life. Jesus is the Way, the Truth and the LIfe (Jn. 14:6). When I believe in Jesus, I am in the way of life. Jesus is the only way to life. That‚Äôs why it is written that the gate and the path is narrow. The other path is easy and wide, but it leads to death. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to follow You and tell people that You are the path of Life!</em>
	</p><p>Sometimes people say that they believe, but their words and deeds don‚Äôt match up. Jesus, help me to learn from what you teach. Jesus gave the example of a tree in order to understand what a person‚Äôs life looks like. What ‚Äúgrows from‚Äù or comes out of a person‚Äôs life (like fruit grows on a tree or comes from a tree), shows what that person is like.
		
	</p><p>Jesus says that some people think that He will receive them, but they really are doing their works before people and not before God. This is why Jesus will say to them ‚ÄúI never knew you.‚Äù 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to be sincere and do everything for You and not for my own glory.</em>
	</p><p>I want to be wise and not only hear, but fulfill Jesus‚Äô Words. How can I ‚Äúbuild my house‚Äù (that is build my life) on the rock (that is on Jesus)? I can listen to God‚Äôs Word in church and read it myself. I can pray to Jesus and ask Him to lead my by the Holy Spirit each day. I can do what He teaches me to do in His Word. First I hear about something and then I do it with the help of the Holy Spirit!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
