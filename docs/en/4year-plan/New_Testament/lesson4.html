	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Every year Jesus and His parents went to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover. Once, Joseph, Mary, their relatives and acquaintances had all started to journey back home and thought that Jesus was somewhere with their group traveling back. They didn‚Äôt know that Jesus had stayed in the temple.  Joseph and Mary returned to Jerusalem and searched 3 days for Jesus. They found Him in the temple where He was talking with the teachers of the law. He listened to them, asked them questions and answered their questions correctly. Mary said that they were worried and had been searching for him for a long time but He said that He should be in the place that is pleasing to His Father (verse 41). They didn‚Äôt understand Him. Jesus returned home and was obedient to His parents. He grew up wise; God and people loved Him.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus calls God His Father because Jesus is the Son of God. Just as children are with their parents and do what their parents tell them to do, so Jesus was in the place (the temple)  where people gathered to be with God (worship Him) and hear what He told them (study the Word). In my heart, I love God and worship Him wherever I am and not just at a church gathering place. I can read the Bible to know what God is telling me. By His Holy Spirit, Jesus helps me to follow the Word.
		
	</p><p>Jesus was obedient to His parents. He respected them. Jesus helps me to listen to my parents. Jesus called God His Father. This means that Jesus gives us an example of submitting to and listening to God. Jesus Himself is God but He came into the world to save us and was obedient to death, even death on the cross (see Phil. 2:5-11).

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
