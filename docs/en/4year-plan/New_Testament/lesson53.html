</h3>
		<p>The believers waited in Jerusalem, just like Jesus told them. ‚ÄúWhen the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them.  And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, ‚ÄúLook, are not all these who speak Galileans?‚Äù (Acts 2:1-7).</p><p>People from all different nations heard the believers speaking about the mighty works of God in their own languages. They gathered together and Peter shared with the people about salvation in Jesus. Many people (3,000!) believed in Jesus that day and they gathered to study the Word, eat together and pray (verse 42). God did miracles through the apostles and ‚Äù‚Ä¶ continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved‚Äù (v.46-47).</p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus gave believers His Holy Spirit just as He promised. The Holy Spirit gave the believers power to witness about Jesus. This passage talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I see that Jesus wants to pour out the Holy Spirit on each believer. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus and not to people. The Holy Spirit helps people to understand that Jesus is Saviour, God and King. John 16:8-11 also explains the work of the Holy Spirit.
		
	</p><p>__Jesus, fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to share with people about You. Thank you that You are my help. Just as you gave Peter words to share with people, please give me words when I need them. Help me to rely upon You.__
		
	</p><p>Jesus created and builds the Church. The Church is a group of people who love Jesus and follow Him. I am a part of the Church when I believe in Jesus and fellowship with other believers. People that are part of the Church not only read the Bible, pray but they also love Jesus and one another by sharing their lives with one another. Believers often gather together with one another. Others see our lives and how we love Jesus and one another. Often they want to know Jesus too after they see this love. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">God, bless our church and save even more people through us.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
