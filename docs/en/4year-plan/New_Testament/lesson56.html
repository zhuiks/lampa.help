	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Stephen was filled with the Holy Spirit and God did miracles through him (Acts 6:5, 8). Some people wanted to argue with Stephen but they couldn‚Äôt fight with him because he answered wisely. They decided to say bad things about him so that the leaders would kill him. When they judged him, his face was like that of an angel‚Äôs. Stephen told them the history of Israel, how God saved them and how they worshipped Him. He told them that they weren‚Äôt being obedient to the Holy Spirit and that they killed Jesus, the Just One (Righteous One). The leaders stoned Stephen but Stephen saw Jesus standing in heaven and he said to Him, ‚ÄúLord, do not charge them with this sin.‚Äù and he died. The believers buried him and cried. Saul had approved of his death and started persecuting believers in Jesus. They were driven out of Jerusalem and started to live throughout Judea and Samaria. God started to save people in those places through them when they shared about Jesus.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Stephen loved Jesus and people. He served people in the church and wasn‚Äôt afraid to share with people about Jesus. Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, gave him the words that he spoke to his accusers. Jesus was near to Stephen when he suffered for his faith in Him. God helped him to love his enemies even when they threw rocks at him. Because he wasn‚Äôt afraid to share about Jesus and die for his faith, other believers also continued to share about Jesus and many people were saved.
		
	</p><p>Jesus also gives me the Holy Spirit so I can wisely and lovingly share with people about Him. Sometimes people don‚Äôt want to hear what I say about Jesus. Jesus gives me love for them even when they may wrongly accuse me. He is with me when I‚Äôm having a hard time. He promises to receive me into His kingdom and glory after this life.
		
	</p><p>Through faith in Jesus, God can even turn the difficult things in my life into good and use them to bring more people to Christ. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">God, give me love for You and boldness to speak about you and not to fear people. Use my life, so that many people would trust Jesus!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
