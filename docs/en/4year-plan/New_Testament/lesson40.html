	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus teaches me through His parable that He saves by grace. He teaches that the first will be last and the last will be first. That is, people who first heard about salvation in Jesus (the Jews) and people who heard about salvation in Jesus last (the Gentiles) received the same from the master (God). I am saved by grace through faith in Jesus. After the parable, Jesus reminded the disciples that He would die and rise again in Jerusalem. He wants me to understand how He saves us. I don‚Äôt deserve anything, but He gave His life for me and redeemed me so that I could be in His kingdom.
		
	</p><p>The mother of James and John thought that Jesus‚Äô kingdom would be like an earthly kingdom, only better. She and the disciples didn‚Äôt understand that the heavenly kingdom isn‚Äôt like an earthly government. Jesus came to serve us, became a servant and laid down His life. And yet, He is the King of His Kingdom! He is the Servant King. Jesus, help me to follow Your example of love. Jesus showed mercy to the blind men that He healed on the road.
		
	</p><p>I shouldn‚Äôt think about how much I do for Jesus and how much I ‚Äúshould‚Äù get from Him. This is a wrong understanding of God‚Äôs kingdom. I am thankful for His grace and mercy towards me, that I can be a part of His kingdom and that He invited me to ‚Äúwork in His vineyard‚Äù, that is, to tell people about salvation in Jesus. Jesus, thank You for your grace. I want to tell people that today, they can be a part of Your Kingdom through faith in You.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
