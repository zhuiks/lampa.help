	Summary

		<p>Paul wrote a letter the believers in Colosse to encourage them in their faith in Jesus. The people there heard the gospel from Epaphras (Col. 1:7) and Paul himself had been there (Col. 2:1). The believers thanked God because ‚ÄúHe has rescued us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son He loves. 14 We have redemption,the forgiveness of sins, in Him.‚Äù (1:13-14) Jesus created everything and He is before everything and everyone (1:16-17). Christ dwells in believers and this is the hope of glory.</p><p>‚ÄúTherefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, 7 rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, overflowing with gratitude.‚Äù (2:6-7) Paul warned believers to believe the truth and to not believe as the world does. ‚Äú And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive with Him and forgave us all our trespasses. 14 He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the cross. 15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; He triumphed over them by Him‚Äù (2:13-15)</p><p>‚ÄúSo if you have been raised with the Messiah, seek what is above, where the Messiah is, seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on what is above, not on what is on the earth. 3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with the Messiah in God.‚Äù (3:1-3) When believers know Jesus more, He transforms them into His image (3:10). Believers belong to Jesus and this is why they walk in love, forgiving one another and doing all in the name of the Lord Jesus with thanksgiving (3:12-17). Believers should love one another in all different relationships (husbands, wives, children, bosses, workers).</p><p>Paul wrote, ‚ÄúDevote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving. 3 At the same time, pray also for us that God may open a door to us for the message, to speak the mystery of the Messiah, for which I am in prison‚Äù (Col. 4:2-3)</p><p></p><p>Philemon: Paul sent a letter to Philemon in Colosse. The church gathered in his home. Onesimus was Philemon‚Äôs slave and had ran away to Rome where he became a believer in Jesus. Paul wanted Philemon to receive Onesimus back as a brother in Christ (v. 16). Paul wanted them to reconcile and was ready to pay Philemon whatever Onesimus owed him (v. 18).</p><p></p></section>

		<p>I know that Jesus is God. He was with God the Father and the Holy Spirit when they created everything. He gave me the Holy Spirit and Jesus lives within me. His presence with me is the hope of glory. That is, I am certain that i will be with Him eternally in heaven (in glory) because right now He is with me. This is amazing news. I am very thankful to Jesus that He with with me now. I am in His kingdom and I will be with Him forever. He forgave my sin on the cross and He renews and changes me. I want to be more like Jesus. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to walk in love, forgive others and abide in the Word. When I hear different ideas and philosophies from people, help me to remember what the Bible says about it so that I won‚Äôt be deceived.</em>
	</p><p> Jesus, Your forgiveness and love changes my relationships. You are pleased when I obey my parents (3:20). I sometimes don‚Äôt want to obey. Onesimus didn‚Äôt want to listen to his master, Philemon. But Jesus changed his life and could help him to reconcile with Philemon. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, change my life and give me love for You and those around me. Help me to forgive those who offend me. You forgave me and I want to forgive too! Teach me when I read the Word and give me a heart that is thankful to You for all that You have done, are doing and will do for me. Jesus, give me a desire and opportunity to share with people about You: the God who forgives the sins of those who trust in Him.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

You are pleased when I obey my parents (3:20). I sometimes don‚Äôt want to obey. Onesimus didn‚Äôt want to listen to his master, Philemon. But Jesus changed his life and could help him to reconcile with Philemon. __Jesus, change my life and give me love for You and those around me. Help me to forgive those who offend me. You forgave me and I want to forgive too! Teach me when I read the Word and give me a heart that is thankful to You for all that You have done, are doing and will do for me. Jesus, give me a desire and opportunity to share with people about You: the God who forgives the sins of those who trust in Him.__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script></div>
