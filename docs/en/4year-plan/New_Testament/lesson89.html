	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Peter was a disciple of Jesus. He wrote letters to believers in different areas.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 1: He wrote that believers are born again and have an incorruptible inheritance and living hope through faith in Jesus. Difficulties and suffering test and strengthen their faith. Believers live holy lives and not according to the flesh, “ knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, 19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.“ (1:18-19). Their faith and reliance is upon God, that Jesus will come to save their souls. They are born of the Word of God (1:23). “The Word of the Lord endures forever” (1:25)</p><p></p><p>Ch. 2: Believers don’t reject the Word of God, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 10 Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.“ (2:9-10). Believers submit to the authorities. Sometimes believers suffer as Jesus suffered, “ For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.“ (2:21).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 3: Peter wrote about how wives and husbands should love and respect one another. Believers should love others and be humble. Sometimes they suffer for doing good, “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit“ (3:18). In water baptism, believers turn to God that He would cleanse their conscience through faith in the resurrection of Jesus (3:21).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 4: Believers don’t live according to the selfish flesh but in holiness. Peter wrote, “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.“ (4:8). Believers shouldn’t be surprised when they suffer for their faith. “If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you“ (4:14). They can trust God.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 5: Peter wanted leaders to care for other believers as shepherds. Jesus Himself is the chief Shepherd. “Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you“ (5:6). “Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. 10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you“ (5:8-10).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>In Jesus, I have a living hope. I know that He will come to take me to Himself to live eternally with Him in heaven. When life here is difficult, I can remember that I have a heavenly inheritance (eternal life with Jesus) awaiting me. I expect His return.  I am thankful that He paid for my sin with His own blood and this is why I want to live in purity as I wait for Jesus.
		
	</p><p> It’s important for me to know what God says to me in the Word because the Word is eternal. In the Word, I can find out the truth and promises of God. Through the Bible I can come to know Jesus better. I trust the Bible and want to read it every day.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, teach me when I read the Bible. Show me how to live according to Your Word.</em>
	</p><p>People without Jesus live however they want and sin against God. Their behavior is very dangerous and they harm themselves and those around them. Jesus helps me to live holy because He gave me the Holy Spirit. I rely upon His strength to live pleasing to God. He helps me to love others. When people see that I love others, they can understand how Jesus loves them. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to be loving.</em>
	</p><p>People without God don’t like it that believers in Jesus don’t do what they do or don’t approve of what they do. They can be against me and persecute me because of my faith in Jesus. Even when I suffer because of faith in Jesus, I can be joyful. Jesus is with me. He also went through a difficult path. With His help, I can follow His example and remember the living hope and the heavenly inheritance that awaits me. He is my joy. I rely upon Him.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету.

Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово.

Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков.
