	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus wants me to come to Him. He loves me and blesses me. He receives me, when I come to Him. I can talk to Jesus and know that He hears me even when I don‚Äôt see Him. I know that He is king. I know that He showed His love when He died on the cross for my sin. He showed that He is God when He rose from the dead. He is alive and wants me to be near Him now and forever. He is near me. I can be with Jesus when I believe in Him. The Bible says that Jesus lives in my heart when I believe in Him. (Eph. 3:17, see also 2 Cor 6:16, Eph 2:22, Col. 1:27)
		
	</p><p>Jesus has a kingdom. I can be in His kingdom when I trust Him. Being in His kingdom means that I follow Him, my King. He is the most important and I want to do what pleases Him because I love Him. How can I know what pleases Him? From the Bible! His Word teaches me about Him and His heart (what He loves). 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, teach me to love You and to live close to You (to fellowship with You). Help me to know that You are the most important and that it‚Äôs worth it to follow You. Lead me. I want to follow You.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
