	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus taught all the people. “Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, “This Man receives sinners and eats with them.” (v.2) Jesus then told some parables. One of them was: “Then He said: “A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.” (v.11-13) Later when things were really difficult for him, he said “ I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,  and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’ But “ when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.” (v.18-20) And his father threw a party for his son “ for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” (v.24) The father’s older son heard the party and complained to the father that he had never thrown a party for him even though he had always lived correctly. The father said “…‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.’” (v.31)</p></section>

		<p>In His parable, Jesus tells about 2 sons who represent 2 kinds of people. The first is the younger son, who didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He took what he could from his father and lived his own way. But later he realized his mistake, repented and by his father’s mercy became a part of the family again. Maybe I am like this son? I want to live my own way and I don’t care what God says, what the Bible says and what people tell me about Jesus. There were a lot of people like that who repented and started to trust God and follow Him in the time when Jesus lived on the earth. They were spiritually dead and far from God but through faith in Jesus they became alive and close to God. I also can come to the Heavenly Father through faith in Jesus and know that He receives me. I can tell people about Jesus’ love and tell them that God wants to forgive their sin and give them eternal life.
		
	</p><p>But maybe I’m more like the 2nd son. He also didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He just did what he was suppose to do out of obligation or duty. He thought that he deserved a party because he was obedient but he didn’t know his father. He didn’t want his younger brother to find the father’s mercy and love. He thought that only he, who had lived right should get what was good. He didn’t know the loving heart of his father and he wasn’t glad when his brother who had been “dead” became “alive”. In the time when Jesus lived on earth there were pharisees who knew God’s law and fulfilled it well. They thought that they deserved good things from the Heavenly Father. They complained when “sinners” ate with Jesus and He talked with them. They weren’t glad when people who had been “dead” and far from God started to come to God through Jesus and became “alive”. Maybe I also live right and think that I deserve good things from God because of “my righteousness”? In reality, all people sin and everyone needs the righteousness of Jesus to be part of God’s family. Why do I listen to God or my parents or do what is right? Love and thankfulness towards God the Father give me a desire to obey God. When I see the loving heart of God, I want to call everyone to Him that they would also be near to God and join the party that God has planned for all those who love Jesus and those that He loves so much!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету.
