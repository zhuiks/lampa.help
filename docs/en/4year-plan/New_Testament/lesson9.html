		<p>People were preparing to celebrate Passover. Jesus was in the temple in Jerusalem. He noticed that people were selling animals for the sacrifices and changing money, right in the temple. Jesus, “When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overturned the tables. 16 And He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things away! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!” 17 Then His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for Your house has eaten Me up.” (v. 15-17). (see also Ps. 69:9).</p><p>The leaders there wanted Jesus to show them a miracle and  prove to them that He had authority to cleanse the temple. “Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” (v.19). He was speaking of His death and resurrection. The disciples later understood what He meant. During the celebration, many people saw Jesus’ miracles and believed in Him(v. 23). “But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men, 25 and had no need that anyone should testify of man, for He knew what was in man” (v. 24-25).</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The temple was a place to worship God. There, people prayed and brought sacrifices to God. And now, where is the temple? The Bible says that believers themselves are the temple of God because the Holy Spirit lives in them (1 Cor. 6:19). In this passage, it describes how people were selling animals in the part of the temple where the Gentiles (non-Jews) could come and worship God. Imagine that you came to a place to  pray and people there were selling food as if it were a market or supermarket! If someone was selling a cow or a sheep right next to you, would it distract you from praying? Jesus didn’t want people to bother those who were praying to God. He didn’t want the temple to become a shopping mall! What did He do? He made a whip. We don’t know how much time this took, but we see that Jesus wasn’t quick- tempered. He thought about how to cleanse the temple and drive out the animals and people. He planned what he did. Jesus always carefully plans what He does and thinks about exactly how He will do it. If He wants to “drive” something out of my life, I believe that He is doing the right thing. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me and cleanse me, so that nothing in my heart would hinder my close fellowship with You.</em>
	</p><p>Sometimes I hear Jesus’ words but I don’t understand them right away. In this passage, twice the disciples heard Jesus say something and only later understood what He was talking about. Jesus fulfilled ancient prophecy when He cleansed the temple (see Ps. 69:9). He showed them that for Him, worshiping God was important and He didn’t want anything to hinder that. What gets in the way of my worship of Jesus? How can Jesus help me, so that it won’t hinder me anymore?
		
	</p><p>Jesus said that His body would be “destroyed and in three days raised up again.” He died and on the 3rd day rose again, just as He said. Jesus laid down His life and took it up again. I believe that He fulfilled God’s Word. Believing in Jesus, my relationship with God changes: I can come to God and worship Him at any time in any place because His Holy Spirit is in me. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you, Jesus, for the opportunity to be with you forever!</em>
	</p><p>Jesus didn’t trust in people and their opinion about Him. Often people’s opinions are important to me. But really, God’s opinion is what is important. The opinion of people changes and I can’t rely upon it. (Today someone wants to be my friend and the next day they don’t). I should trust Jesus. He never changes and He is faithful. It’s not important if people speak of or think well of me. It’s important that I love God and ask Him for help to love others. It’s important to remember that Jesus loves me and wants me to know His love!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here.
