	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus justifies us by faith. Our suffering for the sake of our faith changes us and gives us hope. God by the Holy Spirit gives us love in our hearts. (5:5) People usually are not willing to die for others, ‚ÄúBut God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.‚Äù (5:8) Through Adam, sin came into the world and into human nature. Through faith in Jesus there is forgiveness of sins (a gift of grace) and reconciliation with God. Sin leads to death. Jesus‚Äô grace gives life. ‚Äú For as by one man‚Äôs disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man‚Äôs obedience many will be made righteous.‚Äù (5:19)</p><p>Faith in Jesus changes how we live. ‚ÄúNow if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, 9 knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him. 10 For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. 11 Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù (6:8-11) We are no longer slaves of sin because Jesus freed us. ‚ÄúFor the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù (6:23)</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.‚Äù (7:12) The Law shows us that we sin and it cannot save us, but condemns us when we don‚Äôt fulfill it. Sin within me wants to act against the law. Jesus rescues me from this body of death.</p><p>‚ÄúThere is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. 3 For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. ‚Äù (8:1-4) ‚ÄúBut if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.‚Äù (8:11) We don‚Äôt live for ourselves but now live by the Spirit. By the Spirit, we can call God, Father. We suffer now, but we have the hope of glory, that we will be with Jesus later. ‚ÄúFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äù (8:18)</p><p>We wait with patience. The Holy Spirit, who lives within us helps us in our weakness. ‚Äú And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.‚Äù (8:28) ‚ÄúWhat then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?‚Äù (8:31) We experience difficulties now but we will be with Jesus in His glory. We can be sure that, ‚ÄúFor I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù (8:38-39)</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>My faith in Jesus changes me. Before I believed in Jesus, I was a slave to sin and I had no power to do what is right. But now, through faith in Jesus, I can live with Him. That is, His Holy Spirit lives in me and gives me new desires (to love God and others), and new life. The Life of Jesus in in me.
		
	</p><p>Sin controlled me before. Even if I didn‚Äôt really want to sin, I didn‚Äôt have strength to resist sin. But now, Jesus is My Lord and His Holy Spirit lives in me. I want to live for Jesus. I can ask Him for help and He will give me strength to act according to the Spirit. The Holy Spirit frees me from sin and death through faith in Jesus. In Jesus, I have a new nature, a new direction and a new destination!
		
	</p><p>All people without Jesus are dead in their sins. We all inherited the sinful nature of Adam. But believers in Jesus are given new life. He makes believers alive. Through faith in Jesus, by His grace and mercy, He gives us forgiveness, justification (that is, we are made right according to God‚Äôs Law), and the hope of glory. I know that despite the difficulties in this life, Jesus promised to receive me into glory. Nothing can separate me from His love. Jesus is always with me and His promises are firm and faithful. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to reckon myself dead to sin and alive for God in Jesus Christ, my Lord.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

By the Spirit, we can call God, Father. We suffer now, but we have the hope of glory, that we will be with Jesus later. ‚ÄúFor I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.‚Äù (8:18)\n  We wait with patience. The Holy Spirit, who lives within us helps us in our weakness. ‚Äú And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.‚Äù (8:28) ‚ÄúWhat then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?‚Äù (8:31) We experience difficulties now but we will be with Jesus in His glory. We can be sure that, ‚ÄúFor I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, 39 nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù (8:38-39)\nCharacter:\n- The Holy Spirit lives in believers in Jesus\n- Jesus gives life\n- There is hope in Jesus\n- Jesus frees from sin and death\n- Jesus died and rose again\n- Jesus justifies by His grace and mercy\n- God gives the gift of eternal life to believers\nApplication: |\n  My faith in Jesus changes me. Before I believed in Jesus, I was a slave to sin and I had no power to do what is right. But now, through faith in Jesus, I can live with Him. That is, His Holy Spirit lives in me and gives me new desires (to love God and others), and new life. The Life of Jesus in in me.\n  Sin controlled me before. Even if I didn‚Äôt really want to sin, I didn‚Äôt have strength to resist sin. But now, Jesus is My Lord and His Holy Spirit lives in me. I want to live for Jesus. I can ask Him for help and He will give me strength to act according to the Spirit. The Holy Spirit frees me from sin and death through faith in Jesus. In Jesus, I have a new nature, a new direction and a new destination!\n  All people without Jesus are dead in their sins. We all inherited the sinful nature of Adam. But believers in Jesus are given new life. He makes believers alive. Through faith in Jesus, by His grace and mercy, He gives us forgiveness, justification (that is, we are made right according to God‚Äôs Law), and the hope of glory. I know that despite the difficulties in this life, Jesus promised to receive me into glory. Nothing can separate me from His love. Jesus is always with me and His promises are firm and faithful. __Jesus, help me to reckon myself dead to sin and alive for God in Jesus Christ, my Lord.__\n\n  *Teacher!
