	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Charitable giving: When giving, don’t do it before people in order for them to see your good works, but do it secretly, with humility (v.1-4). Prayer: Prayer is before God and not to show off before people. Jesus taught how to pray (v. 5-15). Fasting: keep a fast secretly and not to show off before people. It is done before the Heavenly Father. Treasures and Cares: Don’t gather treasures on earth, which are temporal, but gather treasures in heaven “for where your treasure is, there your heart is.”(v. 21). “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon” (v. 24). The Heavenly Father takes cares of His own and knows their needs. Do not be anxious. “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (v.33).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus taught about how my heart should trust Him and the Heavenly Father. I don’t do good things so that people would see me and think that I’m good. If I give money or pray or fast, I do everything before God and not before people. God is my Heavenly Father who sees me always.He knows the motives of my heart. He knows if I do things out of love for Jesus and others or for my own glory. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to do things before the Heavenly Father and not before people.</em>
	</p><p>Jesus taught that I can’t live for myself and for Him at the same time. I can’t live for riches and prestige in life and for God’s glory. God is worthy of my whole life. He cares for me today and always. He is my security. He cares for all of my needs. His kingdom is in heaven. Jesus said that I should seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and he promises that all things will be added to me. How can I seek the kingdom of heaven? The kingdom of heaven is where Jesus reigns. Jesus is most important. I want Him to be the most important in my heart. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me that You would always be the most important in my life. All that you do, Jesus, is right. Teach me to do what is right and pleasing to You.</em>
	</p><p>I can pray, read the Bible and listen to the Holy Spirit when He leads me and shows me how to follow Jesus. I can ask Jesus for help to love God and others. When I love Jesus, then I love others,  live pleasing to Him and will naturally seek God’s kingdom because I want to do what makes the Heavenly Father glad. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you God, that You help me to seek Your kingdom and You promise to care for my needs. I love You!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Хронологические планы уроков, обучающие видео для детского служения, идеи для изучения золотых стихов, идеи поделок и детские Библейские песни.\n\nabout = \n  Когда мы помогали в новой церкви в Средней Азии, наш пастор попросил команду детского служения разработать хронологическую Библейскую программу, которая была бы сосредоточена на том, как Христос виден в во всем Писании. Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим. Пусть Бог даст вам радость в подготовке и проведении уроков!\n\nscripture = Отрывок\nverse = Золотой стих\nmain-truth = Главная истина\nsummary = События\ncharacter = Характер Бога\napplication = Применение\nsongs = Идеи для песен\n"}</script>
