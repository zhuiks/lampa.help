	Summary
</h3>
		<p>In chapter 4, it says that God gives believers the Holy Spirit who helps us to understand that God has adopted us. Believers can call God their Father and know that they will inherit eternal life. (4:6-7) Paul gave an example from the Old Testament about Ishmael and Isaac. Ishmael, the son of the slave woman,  represents the Law which doesn‚Äôt lead to relationship with God. He was brought forth by the law, through works. Isaac, the son of the free woman, represents the promise of God, which leads to relationship with God according to grace through faith. (4:22-24) All believers in Jesus are like the children of the free woman.</p><p>In Chapter 5, Paul writes that believers should walk in the Spirit (that is, follow Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit). Jesus gives us power to live God‚Äôs way through the Holy Spirit (5:16) ‚ÄúBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.‚Äù When a person belongs to Jesus (through faith in Him), he won‚Äôt live according to his selfish desires but will live by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit (v.24)</p><p>In Chapter 6, he writes that believers don‚Äôt boast in their deeds or in how they fulfill the law which doesn‚Äôt save them. They boast in Christ Jesus and in what He accomplished on the cross (6:14).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. When I love Jesus (and He helps me to love Him), then just like an apple tree that grows apples, so my life (and my heart) will be filled with love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. I can ask Jesus to grow the fruit of the Holy Spirit in my life and that I would love Him and others more and more.
		
	</p><p>What does the fruit of the Holy Spirit look like? What do these look like:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? What examples of each one can I think of? Jesus is God and He showed us all of the fruit of the Spirit. Which examples from the life of Jesus can I remember that are examples of:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? Do I believe that Jesus can help this fruit to grow in my life? He wants to help me. I can ask of HIm. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please fill me with Your Holy Spirit and grow the fruit of the Spirit in my life. Help me to live pleasing to You and to love You.</em>
	</p><p>Paul warned believers to not try to come to God through the works of the law. I can only come to God through faith in Jesus Christ, trusting in His righteousness. This is why I boast in the cross. ‚ÄúBut God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.‚Äù (6:14) On the cross, Jesus died for my sin and paid for my iniquities. There, He conquered sin and death. He rose again and gives me forgiveness and new life in the knowledge of HIm. I don‚Äôt want to live like the world lives. People want to show that they are right. I want to live pleasing to Jesus, so that people would see that He is right. He is the Loving Victor who makes us God‚Äôs children by His grace and not according to my works. I want to be a part of God‚Äôs family and tell people that they also can become God‚Äôs children through faith in Jesus.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
