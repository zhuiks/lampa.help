	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 1: Paul encouraged Timothy to use the gift of God that he received. Paul was in prison because of his faith in Christ Jesus and said, ‚ÄúSo don‚Äôt be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, or of me His prisoner. Instead, share in suffering for the gospel, relying on the power of God.9 He has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.‚Äú (1:8-9). He wanted Timothy to continue following the truth and right teaching. Many people left Paul but he was thankful to those who helped him.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 2: Paul wanted Timothy to pass on the truth to others and to be a good worker. ‚ÄúYou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 2 And what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, commit to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.‚Äú (2:1-2). ‚ÄúBe diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who doesn‚Äôt need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth.‚Äú (2:15).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 3: Timothy followed Paul‚Äôs example. The last days will be hard; people will love their own pleasures and not God (3:9).  ‚Äú In fact, all those who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.‚Äú(3:12). Paul exhorts Timothy to hold on to God‚Äôs Word which teaches about salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. ‚ÄúAll Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training in righteousness, 17 so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.‚Äú (3:16-17).</p><p></p><p>Ch. 4: Paul wanted Timothy to teach others the truth. Paul knew that he would soon die for his faith in Jesus but was confident that he had lived rightly before God and awaited the reward from Jesus in His kingdom. Paul wanted Timothy and Mark to come to him soon (4:9 and 11). Luke (author of the gospel of Luke and the book of Acts) was with Paul. When Paul stood in court for his faith, God was with him, strengthened him and helped him to share the gospel (4:17). He knew that God would keep him for His heavenly kingdom.</p><p></p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>Paul gave instructions to Timothy, a young leader in the church. I can apply what he wrote him to myself. It‚Äôs important for me to follow the truth, read the Bible and pass on the truth to others. Paul suffered for his faith in Jesus and said that all believers in some way will be persecuted for following Jesus (3:12). Paul knew that he would die soon for his faith in Jesus but he awaited a crown of righteousness in heaven. He thought of the good things that awaited him in heaven. He wanted Timothy to continue to believe in the truth of the Bible. I believe that the Bible is from God and that it is the truth which guides my life. I want to better know and fulfill what is written there. Jesus, teach and lead me.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, help me 1) to follow the truth of the Bible 2) to share the truth with others and 3) to think about what awaits me in Your Heavenly Kingdom in my sufferings.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
