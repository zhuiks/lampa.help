	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus was passing through the region of Samaria and stopped by a well. At that time, the people living in Samaria and the Jews didn‚Äôt get along and didn‚Äôt talk with one another (v.9). The disciples went to buy something to eat. Jesus saw that a Samaritan woman came to draw water asked her to give him some water. She was surprised that he spoke to her. Jesus explained that, ‚Äú13‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWhoever drinks of this water will thirst again, 14 but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.‚Äù When Jesus told the woman things that He knew about her life,  she understood that Jesus spoke God‚Äôs Words and she wanted to find out about how to correctly worship God. Jesus said ‚Äú22 You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. 23 But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.‚Äù The woman  knew that the Messiah would tell them what they needed to know. He said, ‚ÄúI who speak to you am He.‚Äù She was glad and ran to the city to tell everyone about Jesus. Many people came to meet Jesus. He was with them for 2 days and in the end, the people said to the woman, ‚Äú42 Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.‚Äù</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus came to a place where people from His area and that place usually didn‚Äôt befriend each other. He went there because He is the Saviour of the world; He loves all people and wants all people to be saved through faith in Him.  I also can go to places where perhaps people don‚Äôt want to be friends with me in order to tell them about the love of Jesus. I can tell them that Jesus is the Saviour of the world.
		
	</p><p>Jesus knew everything about the woman at the well. He knew that she needed the life that only Jesus can give people. He knows everything about me. He loves me and wants me to trust Him and believe that He is the Messiah and the true Saviour of the world. Do I believe that Jesus is my Saviour? Have I asked Him to forgive my sins and to help me to love Him more than anything or anyone? I can come to Jesus right now to receive salvation just like the people of Samaria came to Jesus in the story.
		
	</p><p>Jesus told the woman that He gives living water, so that she would never thirst again. When I have needs (for love, for wisdom, for help, for peace, for strength), I can ask Jesus and He gives me to ‚Äúdrink‚Äù, that is, He takes away the thirst and gives me His Spirit. He is my source of life!
		
	</p><p>Jesus also said to the lady, that God wants us to worship Him in spirit and in truth. He helps me to worship Him rightly. He gives me the Holy Spirit and gave me the Bible (the truth) so that I can fellowship with Him and know His heart and His character.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
