	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul and Barnabas were in an area called Galatia (Acts 14). They heard that some of the believing Jews told the believing Gentiles that they should keep the whole law if they wanted to be real believers in Jesus (Gal 1:6). Paul wrote a letter to the believers in Galatia so they would remember that all people are saved by Jesus‚Äô grace through faith in His righteousness and not by keeping the law (which is impossible). Only Jesus (who is God and man) fulfilled the whole law (Rom. 8:3-4). Paul wrote, ‚Äúknowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified‚Äù (Gal 2:16). Believers understand that Jesus fulfilled the whole law and  gives them new life. ‚ÄúFor I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. ‚Äú (2:19-20).</p><p>Abraham was justified by faith and God gave him the promise, ‚ÄúAnd the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel to Abraham beforehand, saying, ‚ÄúIn you all the nations shall be blessed: ‚Äù9 So then those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.‚Äù (3:8) Jesus died for us ‚Äúthat the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.‚Äù (3:14) The Law was given after Abraham and acted as a ‚Äúharsh tutor‚Äù that showed us that we couldn‚Äôt be perfect in our own strength. Now, we are not under Law because Jesus already came. ‚ÄúFor you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ‚Äôs, then you are Abraham‚Äôs seed, and heirs according to the promise.‚Äù (3:26-29)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus saves me and everyone who believes in Him by grace. Trying to fulfill the law doesn‚Äôt save me. I am wrong if I think that God will accept me if I do good works. God accepts those who put faith in the perfect life, sacrifice and victory of Jesus. I trust the righteousness of Jesus and not my ‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù. When I believe in Him, by grace, He forgives my sin and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit, who lives in me and helps me to live pleasing to God.
		
	</p><p>__Jesus, I believe that my salvation is through Your righteousness. Help me to tell others that You are the only Savior, the One who fulfilled the Law, lived a perfect life, gave Your life as a perfect sacrifice, died and rose again to justify me and all those who believe in You. Help me to not rely upon my own strength, but to rely upon You and Your Holy Spirit to live for You.__

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
