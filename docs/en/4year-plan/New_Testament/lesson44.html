	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jesus was near Jerusalem. He asked His disciples to get a foal of a donkey from a certain person so that Jesus could ride on it into Jerusalem. By this He fulfilled prophecy from Zech 9:9</p><p>Matt 21:6-11: “So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them. They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying:“Hosanna to the Son of David! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!”  And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?” So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”</p><p>verses 12-22: Jesus drove the sellers out of the temple and said “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of thieves.” (v.13) The leaders in the temple were upset that children were praising Jesus when He healed people. Jesus answered that the children fulfilled God’s Word (Ps. 8:2).</p><p>verses 23-27: The leaders wanted to know by what authority Jesus did and said these things. But they didn’t want to recognize that John the Baptist’s ministry was from God and so Jesus didn’t answer their question.</p><p></p><p>Verses 28-32: Jesus told a parable of the 2 sons. In the end, one was obedient and one was not.</p><p></p><p>Verses 33-45: Jesus told the parable of the vineyard and the workers who didn’t receive the master’s son when he came to the vineyard. The Pharisees heard the parable and wanted to lay hands on Jesus.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I believe that Jesus is God and King of kings. He is the only King who is worthy of worship. Many years before Jesus came to earth, the Holy Spirit directed the prophet Zechariah to write that the King and Saviour would come into Jerusalem on a donkey. I see that God fulfills all that He says in His Word. I can trust the Word and God. The Bible is the truth.
		
	</p><p>People worshiped Jesus. They laid  their clothes  and palm branches on the road where He rode and cried out “Hosanna!” which means “Lord, Save!” I also can worship Jesus. I can sing songs to Him, pray to Him and thank Him for salvation. I want to give Him honor because He is worthy! People in Jerusalem heard the noise and asked “who is this?” When I praise Jesus with my life and people ask “who is this Jesus that you are talking about?” I can answer that He is the Saviour and the Eternal King! What does a king do? A good king rules over people, he takes care of them,  he makes decisions and he says what is right and wrong, he is the one in charge. Is Jesus my king?  Jesus, be the King of my life. You are my Saviour and You want to save everyone.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
