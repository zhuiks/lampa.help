	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Jairus was a leader in the synagogue and asked Jesus to come to his house and heal his 12 year old daughter who was dying. A crowd of people followed Jesus and along the way, a certain woman who had been very sick for 12 years touched the edge of Jesus‚Äôs clothes, believing that He could heal her. She was instantly healed. He asked who touched Him but His question puzzled people because many people were crowding around and touching Jesus as they walked along the road. But He knew that the woman had touched Him with faith. She told Jesus that she had touched Him and He told her that now she was not only physically healed but that He forgave her sin.</p><p>Just then people came and said that Jairus‚Äôs daughter died but Jesus said to him ‚Äúdo not fear! Only believe!‚Äù (v. 50). At Jairus‚Äôs house, Jesus allowed only the parents and 2 of his disciples to be in the room. Jesus told the girl to get up and He raised her from the dead! She came alive! Jesus said that they should feed her and her parents were so glad. Jesus told them not to tell anyone about the miracle that He did.</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jairus and the woman in the crowd both knew that Jesus could help them. Their circumstances were very difficult and doctors couldn‚Äôt help them. But for Jesus nothing is impossible. He is my hope and my help. In difficult or simple circumstances, I can turn to Jesus for help. Jesus told Jairus ‚Äúdo not fear, only believe!‚Äù Jesus speaks these words to me too.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, help me to trust You and to boldly come to You for help.</em>
	</p><p>Jesus gave the woman physical health and the little girl physical life. But He also forgives sins and gives spiritual life. He can give me a healthy soul: a heart that loves God more than anything and anyone. He can help me to live close to Him and make me very happy in Him. Jesus didn‚Äôt boast or brag when He did miracles. He didn‚Äôt turn the attention towards Himself because He has a humble heart. When I do something good, it is Jesus who helps me to do it. He sees it and I do it for Him because I love Him. All glory to Him!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
