	Summary
</h3>
		<p>2 Pet. 1: Grace and peace are multiplied in the knowledge of Jesus. God gives us everything needed for life and godliness in the knowledge of Him (1:3). He gave us great and precious promises (2 Pet.1:4). Peter knew that he would die soon but he wanted to write believers and remind them of this truth. He himself saw Jesus and all that he did (2 Pet. 1:16). Believers should believe the Word because it was given by the Holy Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21).</p><p></p><p>2 Pet. 2: Peter warned about false teachers. God will judge them, just as He judged fallen angels and ungodly people (2 Pet. 2:4-6). But, ‚Äú ‚Ä¶the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment‚Äú (2 Pet. 2:9). False teachers, ‚Äú‚Ä¶promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them‚Äú (2 Pet. 2:19).</p><p></p><p>Peter wrote this letter to remind believers about the truth that Jesus is coming and then there will be a judgement day. There will be people who say that Jesus is not coming and that there will be no judgement. ‚ÄúThe Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance.10 But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief;  on that day the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, the elements will burn and be dissolved, and the earth and the works on it will be disclosed‚Äú (2 Pet. 3:9-10). This is why believers want to live in holiness. Everything on earth will burn and melt. ‚ÄúBut based on His promise, we wait for the new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness will dwell.‚Äú (2 Pet.3:13). Believers await the return of Jesus and want to be pure before Him in the world. Peter wanted believers to guard themselves from false teaching and said, ‚ÄúBut grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen‚Äú (2 Pet.3:18).</p></section>

		<p>I am thankful to God for all that He has given me. He not only saved me but multiplies grace and peace when I know Him better. I can know Him better when I read the Bible and live, serving Him in the Holy Spirit.

You will deal with the ungodly because You are the Righteous Judge. Jesus knows me and can save me out of temptation.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
