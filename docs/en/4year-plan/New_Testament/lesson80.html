	Application
</h3>
		<p>I belong to Jesus. My life and all that I do and desire and strive for is submitted to Jesus. I am, ‚Äúa living sacrifice‚Äù and worship Him with my life. How can I live for Jesus? In chapter 12 there are a lot of practical examples and advice. I want to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit to love believers. It is written that I should love my enemies.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, help me to love my enemies. You overcame evil with good when You died on the cross. You died for me when I was still a sinner. Thank You for Your love. Help me to love my enemies with the same love.</em>
	</p><p>There are many different kinds of people and people groups (nationalities) in church. Thank you, Jesus that you saved us all! Help us to love one another and not quarrel about things that aren‚Äôt important (about food and people‚Äôs traditions). 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to love my brothers and sisters and live in unity with them.</em>
	</p><p> I learned earlier that Jesus‚Äô righteousness saves me and that I am not under the Law but under grace. Jesus changes me and gives me love from the Holy Spirit. It‚Äôs written, ‚Äúloving another is the fulfillment of the Law.‚Äù Jesus Himself gives me love for God and other people. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, fill me with Your Love and show me how to use the gifts of the Holy Spirit for edifying believers, how to love my enemies, how to live in unity with believers and how to share the gospel with people who don‚Äôt know You. Strengthen my faith in Jesus.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
