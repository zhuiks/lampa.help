	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Paul wanted the Jews to believe in Jesus but many of them didn‚Äôt believe. Many of them tried to find God through works, through the keeping of the Law, and not by faith. (9:2) God shows mercy to whom He wants. He showed the Gentiles mercy when Jesus died for all and not only for the Jews.</p><p>Righteousness is given through Jesus and not through the Law, ‚ÄúFor Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.‚Äù (10:4) ‚Äúthat if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. ‚Äù (10:9-10) ‚Äú For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved‚ÄùHow then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? 15 And how shall they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: ‚ÄúHow beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, Who bring glad tidings of good things!‚Äù (10:13-15) ‚ÄúSo then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.‚Äù (10:17)</p><p>God has a good plan for the Jews. Through them He gave God‚Äôs Word and sent Jesus. Now, the Gentiles through faith can become a part of  God‚Äôs ‚Äúfamily tree‚Äù. Gentiles should be thankful that God allowed them to be a part of His family. Now, few Jews believe in Jesus because it is the time for the Gentiles but, ‚Äú‚Ä¶all Israel will be saved‚Ä¶ For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable‚Äù  and later many Jews will believe.(11:26, 29)</p></section>

		<p>I believe that Jesus is my righteousness. I have no righteousness of my own. I can‚Äôt do enough good deeds or keep the law in my own strength in order to be right before God.  I am saved only through faith in Jesus. Jesus is the only Savior for all people. There is no other Savior and no other way. I am thankful that Jesus died for me and not only for Jews.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
