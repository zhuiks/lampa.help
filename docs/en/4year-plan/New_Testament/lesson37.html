	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus said that I have an angel who always sees God‚Äôs face (v. 10). Jesus guards me. Jesus came to earth to save me and all people. Without Jesus, I am like a lost sheep, who got lost in the mountains. Without Jesus‚Äô help, I will perish. But He seeks me and wants me to be a part of his flock so that He can take care of me forever. How does He seek me? When I hear stories about Jesus, when I hear songs about Jesus, when people talk about Jesus, that is when He is calling me to Himself. Through all those things, He reveals Himself to me, so that I would come to Him. When I believe in Jesus, then He received me into His Kingdom, where there is joy, peace and love. I can tell others about Jesus so that they would come to Him and know that Jesus is Savior. Maybe they don‚Äôt know that life without Jesus is very dangerous. I can tell them that Jesus wants to care for them, forgive their sin and receive them into His Heavenly Kingdom. Jesus, help me to tell my friends, relatives and neighbors that You want to and are able to save them. This is Your will, that people would not perish (see John 3:16).
		
	</p><p>In verses 21-35, Jesus taught that if I don‚Äôt forgive another person‚Äôs sin, that means that I don‚Äôt understand His forgiveness towards me. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to forgive those who sin against me because You have forgiven me! Give me strength to forgive. Give me a humble heart that understands Your Great Love. You laid down your life for me, Jesus, even though I deserve punishment. Thank you for Your forgiveness. I want Your forgiveness of my sin to change my life.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
