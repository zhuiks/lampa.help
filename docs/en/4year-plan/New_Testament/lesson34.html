		<p>Jesus was with His disciples and a crowd of people was following Him. They knew that He had done miracles and wanted to be with Him. He fed them miraculously, making an abundance of bread and fish from very little. All the people saw the miracle and believed that He was the Prophet that Moses had spoken of, for whom they were waiting. Then they wanted to make Jesus king, but He left. Jesus sent His disciples off in a boat and went to pray by Himself. Later, He came to them, walking on the water. Peter asked if he could come out to Him on the water and started to walk, but then was scared by the wind and started to sink, but Jesus saved HIm. All the disciples worshiped Jesus and said ‚Äútruly You are the Son of God!‚Äù (v. 33)</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Jesus knew people‚Äôs needs and He had a plan to help them. He knows my needs and can help me. For Jesus, nothing is impossible. Jesus provided for people‚Äôs physical needs. He also provided for their spiritual needs. Everyone needs to eat in order to live (bread in this story). But everyone also needs a relationship (friendship) with God in order to have real life. This is why Jesus said ‚ÄúI am the bread of Life.‚Äù I need to be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus in order to live. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and forgives my sins, He gives me new life with God.
		
	</p><p>Jesus took a small amount of bread and fish and fed a huge crowd of people. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I have (a little or a lot). It‚Äôs important that I give whatever I have to Jesus so that He would be praised and do that which He wants to do with what I give Him. People followed Jesus because they saw His miracles and not because they believed that He is the Son of God. Why do I follow Jesus? Do I want to get something from Him or simply be with Him because I understand that He is Savior and King and the Most Important?
		
	</p><p>__Jesus, help me to love You more. Thank you, Jesus that You are caring and loving. Thank you that You died for me and give me life in You when I trust You.__
		
	</p><p>Peter trusted Jesus and started to walk to Him on the water but then he saw the waves, he got scared and started to sink. Jesus was nearby to save Peter when he cried out to Him. I believe that when I look to Jesus and follow Him, He gives me the opportunity to do that which is impossible to do without Him. If I don‚Äôt trust Jesus, I can‚Äôt do anything miraculous and will ‚Äúsink‚Äù like Peter. But Jesus is my Savior and He lifts me up when I fall. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to always trust You and look to You. You are my Life. You can do all things. Be praised through my life. You are worthy!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
