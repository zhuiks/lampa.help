		<p>Herod put Peter in prison and wanted to kill him. The church was praying for him. ‚ÄúAnd when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, ‚ÄúArise quickly!‚Äù And his chains fell off his hands‚Äù (v.6 -7). The angel led Peter out of prison. Peter went to Mary‚Äôs house (the mother of John-Mark) where the believers were praying for him. At first, they didn‚Äôt believe that Peter came to them and then they were astonished. Then Peter went to a different place.</p><p>Herod was prideful and died.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Peter boldly shared with people about Jesus. That is why Herod put him in prison and wanted to kill him. But God had a plan. He freed Peter miraculously because He had a special plan for Peter‚Äôs life. I can boldly share about Jesus as the Holy Spirit leads me. I know that Jesus is always with me. He can save me out of danger if that is His plan. Nothing and no one can get in the way of God‚Äôs plan. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, give me boldness to follow You. I know that You are the only Saviour. I want everyone to know that only you give forgiveness, love, and true life. Help me to love You and not be afraid of people and evil. You overcame the world, sin and evil. You are for me and I belong to you. As long as I live, You are with me and when I die, You will be with me and I will be with you forever. Thank you!</em>
	</p><p>The church didn‚Äôt know what God‚Äôs plan was for Peter but they prayed for him. I don‚Äôt always know what God wants to do but I can pray for others. I can pray with believers. God hears my prayers and always answers. Sometimes God doesn‚Äôt answer the way that I expect but He answers. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you, Lord, that you hear my prayers and that you fulfill Your plan.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
