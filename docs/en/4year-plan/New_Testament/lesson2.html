		<p>Caesar (the Roman Emperor) ordered all people to go to their hometown to be counted.

Mary gave birth to Jesus there.</p><p>Nearby, there were shepherds watching their sheep and suddenly angels appeared in heaven and told them about the birth of the Saviour, Jesus. They found Jesus and worshipped Him. ‚Äú And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them‚Ä¶And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them‚Äù (Lk.2:17-18, 20).</p><p>Later, Joseph and Mary brought the baby Jesus to the temple. There Simeon saw Jesus and spoke about how Jesus is the Saviour. The Holy Spirit had told Simeon that he wouldn‚Äôt die until he saw the Saviour.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Over and over again in this section of scripture it is written that Jesus is Saviour. This means that I‚Äôm in danger and I need to be saved. I am very glad that Jesus came from heaven to earth and became a man in order to save me. This is very good news!  I believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the Son of Man. I want to praise Him just like the angels praised Him. I want to worship Him just like the shepherd worshipped Him. I want to talk about how He is Saviour and Redeemer just like the shepherds, Simeon and Anna.  
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to praise you and tell everyone the good news that you saved me from sin and want to save everyone from their sin.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
