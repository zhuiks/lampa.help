	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 8: Ezra read the Word and the leaders explained it to the people. The people cried when they heard God‚Äôs Word, but Ezra, Nehemiah, the priests and Levites told them to be glad. According to God‚Äôs Word, they celebrated and rejoiced, remembering the time when they lived in tents after God led them out of Egypt (Lev. 23:43).</p><p>Ch. 9-10: The people confessed their sin to God. The leaders said ‚ÄúStand up. Praise Yahweh your God from everlasting to everlasting. Praise Your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.‚Äù (9:5). The people remembered their history and God‚Äôs faithfulness. They told God that they wanted to follow Him and keep His Word.</p><p>Ch. 11-12: The people decided who would live in Jerusalem and who would live around it. They sang and praised God because the walls were rebuilt.</p><p>Ch. 13: Nehemiah was in Babylon working for the king and when he returned to Jerusalem, he saw many problems. He corrected the people who had stopped serving God the right way and had allowed the enemy of God to live in the temple, and those who had married non Israelite women who didn‚Äôt worship God. Nehemiah wanted people to completely follow God and not repeat the mistake of their fathers who didn‚Äôt listen to God‚Äôs Word and went into captivity to Babylon.</p><p></p><p>Malachi: Malachi told the people that God loved them, but that they weren‚Äôt loving God. They were bringing not worshipping God with their whole hearts, the some of the leaders weren‚Äôt being honest, the some of the priests weren‚Äôt sharing God‚Äôs truth with the people and some of the  men were not being nice to their wives.  God reminded them that He is a great King and said that,‚ÄúFor from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; In every place incense shall be offered to My name, And a pure offering; For My name shall be great among the nations,says the Lord of hosts.‚Äù (1:11)</p><p>Malachi shared God‚Äôs promises to send a messenger (John the Baptist) who would prepare the way for the Messiah (Jesus), who is also a messenger of the New Covenant (new relationship between God and people). The Messiah will be like fire and soap that cleans and refines people. He will judge people. God calls people to return to Him. He promises to bless them when they live for Him completely and trust Him with all they have.</p><p>Some people who feared (loved and respected) God made a book of remembrance and wanted to listen to and follow God. God called them His special treasure. God promised to come one day to judge the earth and to save those who love Him: ‚ÄùBut to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings‚Äù (Mal. 4:2). Again, God promised to send Elijah before He comes to judge the earth. In 3:1, the first coming of Jesus is described and in Ch. 4:1-3, the second coming of Jesus is described.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Ezra read the Word to the people so that they would know God and praise Him. I want to read the Bible, so I can know God and praise Him. The people quickly started to live according to their old habits and walked away from God. God used Nehemiah and Malachi to warn them, so that they would return to Him. I want Jesus to warn and correct me through His Holy Spirit, the Word and believers so that I won‚Äôt start to walk away from God.
		
	</p><p>The people had allowed God‚Äôs enemy to live in the temple. Later, Nehemiah threw him out. Sometimes, I allow some kind of sin to be in my life and in my heart. Jesus wants to be the One and only master of my heart and He can throw out sin.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, please cleanse me and help me to be completely given to You.</em>
	</p><p>Looking at prophecy can sometimes be like looking at mountains that are far away. At first, it seems like all the peaks are lined up together in the same place. In reality, some of the mountain peaks are closer to us and some are farther away. Malachi‚Äôs words were for the people that heard him speak, but they also are for us now. Some of these words already took place when God sent John the Baptist as the messenger to prepare the way for Jesus to come. Jesus says that John was like the Elijah that Malachi wrote about  but that Elijah will come again before God judges the earth (Malachi 4:5, Matt 17:11-13). These words are like 2 different mountain peaks. They look like they are in the same place, but they are for different times. Jesus came to bring us the New Covenant. By grace He saves us, through faith in Him. This last book of the Old Testament points to Jesus coming to save all people and bring the message of salvation and of judgement. Jesus saves all who trust in Him. He will judge all who do not trust in Him. Jesus is coming again!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

God promised to come one day to judge the earth and to save those who love Him: ‚ÄùBut to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings‚Äù (Mal. 4:2). Again, God promised to send Elijah before He comes to judge the earth. In 3:1, the first coming of Jesus is described and in Ch. 4:1-3, the second coming of Jesus is described.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Holy\n- God is worthy of praise\n- God is a jealous God\n- God cleanses and corrects.God is Faithful\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He is King\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus heals sin and brokenness\n- Jesus saves those who fear HIm\n- He will judge those who don‚Äôt love Him\n- Jesus is coming again!\nApplication: |\n  Ezra read the Word to the people so that they would know God and praise Him. I want to read the Bible, so I can know God and praise Him. The people quickly started to live according to their old habits and walked away from God. God used Nehemiah and Malachi to warn them, so that they would return to Him. I want Jesus to warn and correct me through His Holy Spirit, the Word and believers so that I won‚Äôt start to walk away from God.\n  The people had allowed God‚Äôs enemy to live in the temple. Later, Nehemiah threw him out. Sometimes, I allow some kind of sin to be in my life and in my heart. Jesus wants to be the One and only master of my heart and He can throw out sin.__ Jesus, please cleanse me and help me to be completely given to You.__\n  Looking at prophecy can sometimes be like looking at mountains that are far away. At first, it seems like all the peaks are lined up together in the same place. In reality, some of the mountain peaks are closer to us and some are farther away. Malachi‚Äôs words were for the people that heard him speak, but they also are for us now. Some of these words already took place when God sent John the Baptist as the messenger to prepare the way for Jesus to come. Jesus says that John was like the Elijah that Malachi wrote about  but that Elijah will come again before God judges the earth (Malachi 4:5, Matt 17:11-13). These words are like 2 different mountain peaks. They look like they are in the same place, but they are for different times. Jesus came to bring us the New Covenant. By grace He saves us, through faith in Him. This last book of the Old Testament points to Jesus coming to save all people and bring the message of salvation and of judgement. Jesus saves all who trust in Him. He will judge all who do not trust in Him. Jesus is coming again!\n\n  *Malachi prophesied while Nehemiah was governor of Jerusalem.\n  Bible verses with explanation the chronology of Malachi can be found here:\n  http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/guzik_david/StudyGuide_Mal/Mal_1.cfm\n"}</script></div>
