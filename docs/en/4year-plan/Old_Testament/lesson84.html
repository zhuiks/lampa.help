	Summary
</h3>
		<p>2 Chron. 36:1-8: After Josiah, King Jehoahaz reigned for 2 months but then was led away captive to Egypt. Then, “Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king and reigned 11 years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God.” (v. 5).</p><p></p><p>2 Kings 23:31-37-ch.24:1-7: Jehoiakim paid tribute to Pharaoh Neco of Egypt. Then he served Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon for 3 years. When he rebelled against him, many different nations attacked Judah (the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites) according to God’s word through the prophets (v. 24:2). “Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon” (2 Chron. 36:6).</p><p></p><p>Jeremiah: Jeremiah continued to speak God’s Word to the people, that God would destroy Jerusalem because of their disobedience. He also said that their punishment would only be for 70 years (25:11-12). The priests and false prophets wanted to kill Jeremiah for speaking against them, but the leaders wouldn’t allow it (ch. 26). God used the obedience of the Rechabites to show Judah their disobedience (ch. 35).</p><p>Ch. 36: During the reign of king Jehoiakim, God gave Jeremiah His word, which Jeremiah wrote on a scroll. God gave the people an opportunity to repent, “Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.” The people didn’t want to hear the truth and turn to God. The king listened to parts of God’s Word on the scroll and bit by bit cut them off and threw them into the fire (v.23). Jeremiah dictated the words from the scroll that had been burned to his servant (v. 32). God said that none of king Jehoiakim’s sons would sit on David’s throne (v. 30-31).</p><p>Ch. 45-48: God said that he would use Babylon to judge Egypt. He would also judge the Philistines and Moabites. The Ammonites would also be judged but God promised to restore them afterwards (49:1- 6).</p><p></p><p>Habakkuk: The prophet asked God why unrighteousness was allowed to continue in Judah. God answered that He planned to punish Judah using Babylon. Then the prophet asked why God would punish them using a nation that was more evil than Judah. God said that He would later punish Babylon. Habakkuk hoped in God and knew that God would save those who trusted Him.  He wrote, “…the righteous one will live by his faith” (2:4). “Though the fig tree does not bud and there is no fruit on the vines, though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no food, though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls, 18 yet I will triumph in Yahweh; I will rejoice in the God of my salvation! 19 Yahweh my Lord is my strength; He makes my feet like those of a deer and enables me to walk on mountain heights!” (3:17-19).</p><p></p></section>

		<p>Jeremiah spoke God’s Word to the people in Judah, even though they didn’t receive it. The king rejected God’s Word and even burned the scroll, but Jeremiah had it re-written. This shows me that God’s Word cannot be destroyed. People may burn the pages where it is written, but His Word will endure forever. Is. 40:8 says “The grass withers, the flowers fade, but the word of our God remains forever.” Since this is true, I should treasure God’s Word, read it, study it, memorize it, live by it and most importantly: believe it! Reading the Word, I see how many times the Lord spoke something and then fulfilled His Word. I see that He is faithful and righteous in all that He does.
		
	</p><p>King Jehoiakim and the people suffered because they rejected God’s Word. The Bible is filled with examples of people who believed God’s Word and those who didn’t. Those who believed God’s Word had faith in Him. Habakkuk said that the righteous will live by faith (Hab. 2:4). This verse is quoted often in the Bible (Rom. 1:16-17, Gal. 3:11, Heb. 10:38). This verse can be understood by remembering Gen 15:6, where it says, “Abram believed the Lord, and He credited it to him as righteousness.” When I believe God and His Word, He gives me His righteousness. Jesus is my righteousness. He fulfilled all the law and took my punishment for sin upon Himself. He now gives me His strength to love God and others with my life. 2 Cor. 5:7 says that “we walk by faith and not by sight.” Habakkuk reminds me that I can rejoice in God even when circumstances are terrible because I believe that He is the God of my salvation, my strength and the One who helps me to walk daily with Jesus. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please help me to know, believe and walk in Your Word. Help me to love You and believe You, no matter what is happening around me. You are faithful and Your Word is eternal. Thank you that You are my righteousness.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету.

Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово.
