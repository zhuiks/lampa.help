	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Hosea: God wanted to show Israel that they were acting like an unfaithful wife. He used Hosea‚Äôs life to explain this. He told Hosea to marry Gomer, who was a prostitute (she sold her body in sin to other people). She had children and later left Hosea. But Hosea sought Gomer. She had become a slave and Hosea redeemed her. He was a faithful husband to her.</p><p>Hos. 3:5 ‚ÄúAfterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.‚Äù</p><p>Hos. 6:1-3 ‚ÄúCome, let us return to the Lord. For He has torn us, and He will heal us; He has wounded us, and He will bind up our wounds. 2 He will revive us after two days, and on the third day He will raise us up so we can live in His presence. 3 Let us strive to know the Lord. His appearance is as sure as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the land.‚Äù</p><p>Isaiah 54: God said that He is like a husband to His people. His people acted like an unfaithful wife but God showed them his mercy and love. He disciplined the people and sent them into captivity to a different land but promised to return them to their land. ‚ÄúThough the mountains move and the hills shake, My love will not be removed from you and My covenant of peace will not be shaken,‚Äù says your compassionate Lord‚Äù (54:10).</p><p></p><p>Nahum: The prophet Nahum lived during the reign of king Josiah in Judah (the southern kingdom). The Assyrians had already led the northern kingdom of Israel away into captivity. God said that he would punish Nineveh, the capitol of the Assyrian empire for their cruel treatment of God‚Äôs people. God said that He would judge the sinful city. Nahum prophesied that water and fire would destroy the city: 2:6 ‚ÄúThe river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away‚Äù (2:6). ‚ÄúNineveh has been like a pool of water from her first days, but they are fleeing. ‚ÄúStop! Stop!‚Äù they cry, but no one turns back‚Äù (2:8). ‚ÄúThe fire will devour you there‚Ä¶‚Äù (3:15). ‚Äú‚Ä¶the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour the bars of your gates‚Äù (3:13)</p><p>God also wanted to comfort the people who suffered at the hands of the Assyrians. He said:</p><p>1:15 ‚ÄúLook to the mountains‚Äî the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out‚Äù (1:15).  ‚ÄúFor the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes, the majesty of Israel‚Ä¶‚Äù (2:2).</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God loves me very much. He is always with me and promises to be with me forever. When I sin and love something or someone more than God, I am cheating on God (being unfaithful to Him).Hosea‚Äôs life and his attitude towards Gomer showed people that God is faithful to Israel even though they worshiped idols and didn‚Äôt love God. They became slaves to sin but God redeemed them. I can ask Jesus to forgive me and He helps me to love Him more than anyone or anything. When I live my own way, I become a slave to sin. Jesus came to earth and lived a sinless life, died on the cross and on the 3rd day rose again. He paid for my sin with His blood and frees me from the power of sin when I trust Him. He is my Redeemer, (like the example of Hosea and his wife Gomer). Jesus is faithful and I belong to Him. Jesus, help me to love you and follow after you all of my days. I love you.
		
	</p><p>In the book of Nahum, God comforts Israel at a time when Assyria was cruel to them. Israel was suffering for the consequences of their sin, but God still wanted to express His love towards them. He gave them hope in HIm during a difficult time. Maybe I have done something wrong and am suffering the consequences for my sin. God still loves me and even His discipline shows me that He loves me. He wants me to draw close to Him and to trust Him. He is my help and He cares for me when I take refuge in HIm.
		
	</p><p>Earlier, God spoke to the city of Nineveh through the prophet Jonah. At that time, Nineveh repented and God saved them from judgement. But in time, they again started to do evil and God later punished them. God fulfilled His Word in Nahum when the Babylonian Empire came,  captured Nineveh and destroyed the city with water and fire. I can know that God keeps and fulfills His Word. Everything that I read in the Bible is true. I can trust the Bible. Also, I should take the Bible seriously. God hates sin. I also should hate sin and ask Jesus for help to stop doing what is not pleasing to God. Jesus knows those who trust in Him (Nahum 1:7). When people sin against me, He helps me and comforts me. He gives me strength to love my enemies and gives me  hope, knowing that my suffering is temporary. I have a good future when I trust Jesus. He will avenge the evil people in the end because He is the Righteous Judge.
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>About the prophets:
		
	</p><p>God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

He disciplined the people and sent them into captivity to a different land but promised to return them to their land. ‚ÄúThough the mountains move and the hills shake, My love will not be removed from you and My covenant of peace will not be shaken,‚Äù says your compassionate Lord‚Äù (54:10).\n\n  Nahum: The prophet Nahum lived during the reign of king Josiah in Judah (the southern kingdom). The Assyrians had already led the northern kingdom of Israel away into captivity. God said that he would punish Nineveh, the capitol of the Assyrian empire for their cruel treatment of God‚Äôs people. God said that He would judge the sinful city. Nahum prophesied that water and fire would destroy the city: 2:6 ‚ÄúThe river gates are opened, and the palace erodes away‚Äù (2:6). ‚ÄúNineveh has been like a pool of water from her first days, but they are fleeing. ‚ÄúStop! Stop!‚Äù they cry, but no one turns back‚Äù (2:8). ‚ÄúThe fire will devour you there‚Ä¶‚Äù (3:15). ‚Äú‚Ä¶the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies. Fire will devour the bars of your gates‚Äù (3:13)\n  God also wanted to comfort the people who suffered at the hands of the Assyrians. He said:\n  1:15 ‚ÄúLook to the mountains‚Äî the feet of one bringing good news and proclaiming peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah; fulfill your vows. For the wicked one will never again march through you; he will be entirely wiped out‚Äù (1:15).  ‚ÄúFor the Lord will restore the majesty of Jacob, yes, the majesty of Israel‚Ä¶‚Äù (2:2).\n\nCharacter:\n- God is a jealous God\n- He is Holy\n- God is Redeemer\n- God is Holy\n- God is merciful\n- God is faithful and unchanging\n- He is compassionate\n- He is a husband to His people\n- He is good\n- He cares for those to take refuge in HIm.God punishes sin\n- God is Comforter\n- God sees everything\n- God knows everything\n- God guides everything\n- God is the author of history\n- He fulfills His Word\n- God has a good plan\n- God is a righteous judge\nApplication: |\n  God loves me very much. He is always with me and promises to be with me forever. When I sin and love something or someone more than God, I am cheating on God (being unfaithful to Him).Hosea‚Äôs life and his attitude towards Gomer showed people that God is faithful to Israel even though they worshiped idols and didn‚Äôt love God. They became slaves to sin but God redeemed them. I can ask Jesus to forgive me and He helps me to love Him more than anyone or anything. When I live my own way, I become a slave to sin. Jesus came to earth and lived a sinless life, died on the cross and on the 3rd day rose again. He paid for my sin with His blood and frees me from the power of sin when I trust Him. He is my Redeemer, (like the example of Hosea and his wife Gomer). Jesus is faithful and I belong to Him. Jesus, help me to love you and follow after you all of my days. I love you.\n  In the book of Nahum, God comforts Israel at a time when Assyria was cruel to them. Israel was suffering for the consequences of their sin, but God still wanted to express His love towards them. He gave them hope in HIm during a difficult time. Maybe I have done something wrong and am suffering the consequences for my sin. God still loves me and even His discipline shows me that He loves me. He wants me to draw close to Him and to trust Him. He is my help and He cares for me when I take refuge in HIm.\n  Earlier, God spoke to the city of Nineveh through the prophet Jonah. At that time, Nineveh repented and God saved them from judgement. But in time, they again started to do evil and God later punished them. God fulfilled His Word in Nahum when the Babylonian Empire came,  captured Nineveh and destroyed the city with water and fire. I can know that God keeps and fulfills His Word. Everything that I read in the Bible is true. I can trust the Bible. Also, I should take the Bible seriously. God hates sin. I also should hate sin and ask Jesus for help to stop doing what is not pleasing to God. Jesus knows those who trust in Him (Nahum 1:7). When people sin against me, He helps me and comforts me. He gives me strength to love my enemies and gives me  hope, knowing that my suffering is temporary. I have a good future when I trust Jesus. He will avenge the evil people in the end because He is the Righteous Judge.\n\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.\n"}</script></div>
