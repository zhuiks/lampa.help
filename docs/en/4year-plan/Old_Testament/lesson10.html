	Application
</h3>
		<p>God wants relationship with us. When I trust Him, I show that I love Him. It is better to trust God than to try to fulfill my plans in my way like Abram and Sarai did. This story shows me how God wants to give me His promises in His time and that I need to wait for God to do what He promises.
		
	</p><p>Hagar called God, ‚Äúthe God who sees‚Äù. He knows my needs and all that is going on with me. I know that He cares for me. So when God tells me to do something, I know that it is good and right because He sees and knows everything. God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael. They are the great Arab people and today, many of them are Muslim. God saw and heard Hagar when she was having a hard time. He saw and heard Abraham and  Sarah when they were waiting for God‚Äôs promise to give them Isaac. Jesus sees and hears me when I pray to Him. Prov. 15:29 ‚ÄúThe Lord is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.‚Äù When I believe in Jesus, He puts His righteousness on me and then I can be with God and He hears my prayers. God cares for me.
		
	</p><p>God promised many things to Abraham. God made a covenant with Abraham and gave him the sign of circumcision so they would understand that they are a special people that belong to God. This was a physical sign for the people. Today, God doesn‚Äôt require this. But the idea of belonging to God that circumcision demonstrated is important.  I belong to God and become His child through faith in Jesus Christ. Now the way that I live and what I value differs from the world‚Äôs values. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit to help me love God and to live His way.
		
	</p><p>God promised to give Abraham and Sarah a son and He fulfilled His Word. I read the promises of God in the Bible and believe that God fulfills His Word. I trust God. Abraham and Sarah waited a long time for God to fulfill His promise. Sometimes, God wants me to wait until He fulfills His promise. For example, Jesus said that He will return to take believers to be with HIm. I believe that this is the truth, but in faith, I am waiting for His return.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
