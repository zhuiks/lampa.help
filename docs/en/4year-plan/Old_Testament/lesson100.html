	Application
</h3>
		<p>I know that Jesus is coming again to rule on earth, defeat His enemies and fulfill the hope of all who believe in Him. Scripture says that Jesus is King over all. It‚Äôs not important when someone lived (long ago or now), where they lived (in the jungle or in a muslim country), or who they were (rich or poor). Jesus is king over everyone. He is the One and Only Savior and King. People who don‚Äôt trust Him will be punished forever. People who trust Him will be rejoicing forever with Him! Do I believe that Jesus is King? Do I entrust my life to Jesus? Do I want to share with people about Jesus and about the hope that I have in Him? If I answer yes, I can ask for help from the Holy Spirit to know how to share with people. If I answer no, I can ask Jesus to give me love for Him and for others. If we want to love Him more, we can ask and He will help us!
		
	</p><p>When life is difficult here, I can remember the living hope that I have in Jesus. When I believe in Jesus, I have a place in His kingdom. I will be with Him where there are no tears, no pain and no sin! I can rejoice in the hope of heaven!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
