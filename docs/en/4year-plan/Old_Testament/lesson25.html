		<p>Chapt. 18: Moses’ father-in-law, Jethro,  came to him, bringing Moses’ wife and sons. Jethro worshipped God with Moses. He advised Moses to set up more leaders to help serve the people. He later went back home.</p><p>Chapt. 19: God told Moses to invited the people to be His people. They cleansed themselves to prepare to meet with God. “On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered. Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the Lord came down on it in fire. Its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently. As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.” (v.16-19). See also Heb. 12:18-24.</p><p>Chatp. 20: God gave the 10 commandments to the Israelites: 1) You shall have no other gods before Me 2) You shall not make for yourself a carved image…you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. 3) You shall not take the name of God in vain 4) Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy 5) honor your mother and father 6) you shall not murder 7) you shall not commit adultery 8) You shall not steal 9) You shall not bear false witness 10) You shall not covet (Ex. 20:1-17). The people were afraid and wanted God to speak to Moses and not directly to them.</p><p>Chapt. 21-24: God gave Moses specific laws about how the Israelites were supposed to live.</p><p>Moses went up to Mt.Sinai for 40 days to receive the law.</p><p></p><p>See also:</p><p>Gal. 3:24 “Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”</p><p>Gal. 5:14 “For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”</p><p>Hebrews 7:19 “or the law made nothing perfect; on the other hand, there is the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.”</p><p>James 2:10  “For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all.”</p></section>

	Application

		<p>God has made known to me his standard of holiness through his law but I myself in my own strength cannot fulfill the law. I am guilty of breaking God’s law and that’s why I need Jesus. Jesus fulfilled the law for me and when I believe in Him, He gives me his strength to live God’s way. He took my punishment for breaking God’s law when He died on the cross. When I believe in Him, He gives me His Holy Spirit that helps me to love and follow God.  Jesus gives me His righteousness. I don’t have righteousness of my own.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>

Хронологические планы уроков, обучающие видео для детского служения, идеи для изучения золотых стихов, идеи поделок и детские Библейские песни.\n\nabout = \n  Когда мы помогали в новой церкви в Средней Азии, наш пастор попросил команду детского служения разработать хронологическую Библейскую программу, которая была бы сосредоточена на том, как Христос виден в во всем Писании. Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим. Пусть Бог даст вам радость в подготовке и проведении уроков!\n\nscripture = Отрывок\nverse = Золотой стих\nmain-truth = Главная истина\nsummary = События\ncharacter = Характер Бога\napplication = Применение\nsongs = Идеи для песен\n"}</script>
