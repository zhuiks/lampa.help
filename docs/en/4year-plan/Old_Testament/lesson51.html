Then he stood far away and yelled to Abner (Saul‚Äôs army commander), that he should do a better job of protecting the king. Saul blessed David.</p><p>Ch. 27: David was afraid of Saul and decided to live in the land of the enemy. He lived there for over a year.

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>David trusted God and feared Him. He didn‚Äôt want to kill Saul, because he trusted God‚Äôs plan. Even though God had told David long before that he would be Israel‚Äôs king, David didn‚Äôt want to become king through murdering Saul. David trusted God for His timing to fulfill His plan. I can trust God that He will fulfill His plans in His time for my life. Even though Saul acted like David‚Äôs enemy, David continued to respect Saul. Maybe there are people in my life who treat me like an enemy, but God wants me to love them. He gives me strength and wisdom to love them.
		
	</p><p>God sent Abigail to David when he started to avenge himself. God gave her wise words and David was thankful that he didn‚Äôt sin. Sometimes, God sends people to me to warn me. Am I ready to listen to their advice that helps me to trust God and not make a mistake? Am I ready to share advice from the Bible with people when God, by the Holy Spirit shows me that I should say something? Jesus, I want to trust You. Thank you, that you guide my life and help me to love my enemies.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
