	Application
</h3>
		<p>I can ask God for wisdom and know that He will give it. Jesus, helps me to live pleasing to God and to not compromise. I don‚Äôt always remember what is right, but God knows and His Word tells me what is right. God knows what is in my heart and in the hearts of others. I should fear the Lord (respect and revere Him).
		
	</p><p>Solomon wrote the Song of Songs which talks about the deep love between a husband and wife. We can understand this as a picture of Jesus and the Church. Jesus loves us so much that He gave His life for us.
		
	</p><p>Solomon loved God but didn‚Äôt always follow Him. Even at the beginning of his reign, he allowed things that weren‚Äôt pleasing to God. See Deut. 17:14-17. Later, there were big problems. He 1) married a woman that didn‚Äôt worship God alone (1 Kings 3:1). 2) multiplied horses (1 Kings 4:26) and 3) gathered many riches (10:14 and 21).
		
	</p><p>I understand that it‚Äôs easy to start to love God but I need His help to remain faithful. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, give me wisdom to know how to live and give me a heart that is ready to do what You teach me to do. Protect and guard me from the temptation to 1) love those that don‚Äôt love You more than I love You 2) trust in my own strength and not in You 3) find my security in riches instead of in You. Holy Spirit, help me to know and do what is pleasing to God and to express my love for Jesus. Teach me, when I read the Word, so I can know and fulfill what is wise and share God‚Äôs wisdom with people.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
