	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>In these chapters, I see that God always had a plan to send Jesus to earth to save us. He is the only One who can free me from sin. Israel went into captivity because of their sin. They didn‚Äôt love God, didn‚Äôt listen to His Word and worshipped idols. God alone is worthy of worship. He is worthy of obedience and He hates idol worship*. God punished His people sending them to Babylon for a time. My sin separates me from God when I don‚Äôt listen to His Word. I am not loving God when I live my own way. But God promised to return Israel to the land and told them many years ahead of time so that they would know that it was God who freed them. I can draw near to God through faith in Jesus, knowing that He paid for my sin. There will be a day when God will punish all those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus. He will pour out His wrath on the earth but those who trust in Jesus will be with Him forever, where everything is wonderful. I want to trust Jesus now. I want to tell people about Jesus, so that they won‚Äôt have to experience God‚Äôs wrath. I can tell people that Jesus is the only Savior. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">God help me to trust you, follow You and tell people about salvation in Jesus.</em>
	</p><p>About the prophets:
		
	</p><p>God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Verse 6 speaks about the end of the world. His wrath is upon those who are against Him and His people.\n  Ch. 52: God promises to redeem people from captivity. Good news. Verse 7: ‚ÄúHow beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the herald, who proclaims peace, who brings news of good things, who proclaims salvation, who says to Zion, ‚ÄúYour God reigns!‚Äù Verses 11-12 speak of them leaving captivity: ‚ÄúLeave, leave, go out from there! Do not touch anything unclean; go out from her, purify yourselves, you who carry the vessels of the Lord. 12 For you will not leave in a hurry, and you will not have to take flight; because the Lord is going before you, and the God of Israel is your rear guard.‚Äù\n\nCharacter:\n- God is merciful\n- God is always fulfills His promises\n- God teaches us\n- Jesus is Savior, Messiah, Redeemer\n- He is the Savior of all peoples\nApplication: |\n  In these chapters, I see that God always had a plan to send Jesus to earth to save us. He is the only One who can free me from sin. Israel went into captivity because of their sin. They didn‚Äôt love God, didn‚Äôt listen to His Word and worshipped idols. God alone is worthy of worship. He is worthy of obedience and He hates idol worship*. God punished His people sending them to Babylon for a time. My sin separates me from God when I don‚Äôt listen to His Word. I am not loving God when I live my own way. But God promised to return Israel to the land and told them many years ahead of time so that they would know that it was God who freed them. I can draw near to God through faith in Jesus, knowing that He paid for my sin. There will be a day when God will punish all those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus. He will pour out His wrath on the earth but those who trust in Jesus will be with Him forever, where everything is wonderful. I want to trust Jesus now. I want to tell people about Jesus, so that they won‚Äôt have to experience God‚Äôs wrath. I can tell people that Jesus is the only Savior. __God help me to trust you, follow You and tell people about salvation in Jesus.__\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.\n"}</script></div>
