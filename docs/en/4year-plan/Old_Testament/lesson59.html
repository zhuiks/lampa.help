	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>David was a great king and started to think that he could do whatever he wanted. He didn‚Äôt fear God when he took Uriah‚Äôs wife and killed him. Maybe David thought that no one saw him, but God saw everything. God punished David because He loved him and wanted David to return to Him. David repented. God was very merciful to him, in that He didn‚Äôt kill David. David broke God‚Äôs commands. When David returned to God, He forgave him. Later, there were many problems in David‚Äôs family because he had taken many wives and didn‚Äôt raise his children right. During David‚Äôs suffering because of his sins and mistakes, God helped him. He is faithful and merciful.
		
	</p><p>I want to fear God, that is, respect God and be humble before Him. He is a great King and He is worthy of obedience. When I sin, I am not respecting, loving or fearing God. Sometimes one wrong, selfish decision leads to many problems. Jesus is always ready to forgive my sin and change my heart, but I need to understand that sin is harmful and dangerous and wounds me and those around me. Jesus, help me 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">to see dangerous situations and to seek to fulfill Your will and not my own. Remind me of examples from the Bible, so that I would turn to You and give you glory with my life. Help me to love You and Your Word. Help me to respect You above all.</em>
	</p><p>The end consequences for people who live for their own glory and don‚Äôt fear God is frightening and sad (Amnon, Absalom, Ahithophel, Sheba). God doesn‚Äôt want me to continue to live my way. That‚Äôs why He disciplines me, so that I would follow Him, love Him and in the process become more like Jesus.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

During David‚Äôs suffering because of his sins and mistakes, God helped him. He is faithful and merciful.\n  I want to fear God, that is, respect God and be humble before Him. He is a great King and He is worthy of obedience. When I sin, I am not respecting, loving or fearing God. Sometimes one wrong, selfish decision leads to many problems. Jesus is always ready to forgive my sin and change my heart, but I need to understand that sin is harmful and dangerous and wounds me and those around me. Jesus, help me __to see dangerous situations and to seek to fulfill Your will and not my own. Remind me of examples from the Bible, so that I would turn to You and give you glory with my life. Help me to love You and Your Word. Help me to respect You above all.__\n  The end consequences for people who live for their own glory and don‚Äôt fear God is frightening and sad (Amnon, Absalom, Ahithophel, Sheba). God doesn‚Äôt want me to continue to live my way. That‚Äôs why He disciplines me, so that I would follow Him, love Him and in the process become more like Jesus.\n"}</script></div>
