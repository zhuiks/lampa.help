	Application
</h3>
		<p>Today I don‚Äôt need to go to a temple to worship God. Believers in Jesus are themselves considered a temple of God (see 1 Cor. 3:16-17). Jesus gives believers His Holy Spirit, who lives in my heart (when I believe in Jesus). I can praise and worship God with my life. I can give (commit) my life to Jesus and become God‚Äôs ‚Äútemple‚Äù (a place where His glory and His presence dwell, where He is worshiped). I can pray to God and know that He hears me. God warned Solomon and wanted him to love Him and follow Him. God also speaks to me through the Bible and wants me to love Him and follow Him. Jesus, help me to follow You joyfully all of my days!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
