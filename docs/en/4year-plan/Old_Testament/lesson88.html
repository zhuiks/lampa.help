		<p>1: Nebuchadnezzar took many people away from Judah when he conquered it. Daniel and his friends were some of those people. King Nebuchadnezzar had a special plan for Daniel and his friends. He wanted them to serve in his kingdom and wanted them to study the ways for Babylon for 3 years. He also gave them food from his table. But Daniel and his friends couldn‚Äôt eat the king‚Äôs food because it wasn‚Äôt clean according to God‚Äôs law. When Daniel asked to only eat vegetables and drink water, God gave them favor with the person in charge of them. He decided to test them for 10 days and the Babylonians saw that Daniel and his friends looked better than those who were eating the king‚Äôs food. Daniel and his friends continued to study and God gave them wisdom and knowledge. At the end of the 3 years, the king tested them and saw that Daniel and his friends were the best.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 2: King Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream. He wanted to know what it meant. He wanted his wise men to tell him his dream and if they couldn‚Äôt, he would kill all of them. Daniel and his friends prayed to God for help. God told Daniel the king‚Äôs dream and it‚Äôs meaning. In the dream, there was a big statue made of different metals. In the end, a big rock destroyed the statue and became a big mountain that filled the earth. Daniel explained that the different metals were different kingdoms. The big Rock was God‚Äôs eternal kingdom that would destroy all the other ones and endure forever. Nebuchadnezzar said that Daniel‚Äôs God was the best and rewarded Daniel and his friends with good jobs serving him.</p><p></p><p>Ch. 3: King Nebuchadnezzar made a huge idol and gathered the leaders from his kingdom so that they would worship it when the music played. The friends of Daniel: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were there. They did not worship the idol. Other people complained about them to the king. The king gave them another chance to bow to the idol and if not, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. But they said that their God could save them and even if He did allow them to die, they wouldn‚Äôt worship the idol. The king got angry and heated the furnace 7 times hotter. It was so hot that the people who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the furnace died from the heat. The king saw that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn‚Äôt die but that God saved them and that even One who looked like the Son of God was with them in the fire. He told them to come out and saw that even their hair and clothing was not burned by the fire. Then the king praised God and wanted all his people to respect God (v. 28-29).</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Daniel and his friends trusted God and did what was pleasing to Him. They loved God and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt want to eat the king‚Äôs food.  Jesus, help me to follow You even when ‚Äúimportant‚Äù people are telling me to do something else. People saw that following God was good. Jesus is glorified (seen as great) in my life when I follow Him.
		
	</p><p>Daniel knew that God knows everything and that He rules over and controls everything. He knew that God could tell him the king‚Äôs dream. The king then understood that God is the greatest. When I follow Jesus and look to Him for help, others see that He is great. Jesus is the big rock in the king‚Äôs dream that will get rid of all the other kingdoms and rule forever. He is big and strong and He rules over everything and everyone
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">. Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because You are great and Your kingdom is forever.</em>
	</p><p>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in a very difficult situation. In the face of death, they chose to worship God alone. When I am in difficult circumstances, Jesus helps me to not compromise or do what is displeasing to God. The One like the Son of God was with them in the furnace. Jesus, the Son of God, is with me when unbelievers threaten me. Often, when I follow Jesus, unbelievers will understand later that God is great and worthy of praise.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because You are great and Your kingdom is forever.__\n  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in a very difficult situation. In the face of death, they chose to worship God alone. When I am in difficult circumstances, Jesus helps me to not compromise or do what is displeasing to God. The One like the Son of God was with them in the furnace. Jesus, the Son of God, is with me when unbelievers threaten me. Often, when I follow Jesus, unbelievers will understand later that God is great and worthy of praise.\n"}</script></div>
