	Application
</h3>
		<p>Maybe it‚Äôs hard for me to understand all these instructions from God. I know that the Law was given to show me Jesus. The Law points to  the glorious perfect One, that is, Jesus. God really wants me to be holy and to live a holy life. But without Jesus, I can‚Äôt be holy. Jesus is my holiness. He frees me from sin and cleanses me. He gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit who lives in me and helps me to love Jesus and do what Jesus does.
		
	</p><p> Before Jesus, God required many sacrifices so that people would understand that sin leads to death and that everything belongs to God. Today, I know that Jesus was that sacrifice. By His perfect life and once for all sacrifice, He fulfilled the whole Law and satisfied God‚Äôs wrath against me. I‚Äôm  glad that Jesus fulfilled everything for me! Only He could!
		
	</p><p>Also, I see a picture of  Jesus through the different celebrations that God gave to His people. The Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee were times of release or freedom. People understood that God gave them rest and freedom. The slaves were freed and people rested from their work. This is a shadow (or picture) of Jesus. I find real freedom in Jesus. He gives my heart peace (like rest). I want to tell my friends and others that they too can find freedom and rest in Jesus. I can‚Äôt do lots of good things in order to get rest from God or earn forgiveness and grace from Him. Salvation is God‚Äôs gift of grace through faith in Jesus! This is good news!
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>*Jesus is the fulfillment of these celebrations:
		
	</p><p>23:3 The Sabbath: He is our rest. God wanted people to rest from physical labor in order to teach them that Jesus gives spiritual rest to believers in Him (Heb 4:8-11).
		
	</p><p>23:4-8 The Passover: He is our freedom and redemption. Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (Jn. 1:29).
		
	</p><p>23:9-14 The Firstfruits: He is the firstborn from the dead (1 Cor. 15:20). He is the first fruit of our salvation.
		
	</p><p>23:15-21 Feast of Weeks or Pentecost: He gives us a ‚Äúharvest‚Äù (see Acts. 2). On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon believers in Jesus, they shared with the people about Jesus and many people were saved. All the people who became believers were like a spiritual ‚Äúharvest‚Äù.
		
	</p><p>23:23-25 Feast of Trumpets: He is our Help. People blew the trumpets as a warning. The sound reminded them that their sin separated them from God and that they need redemption and cleansing. God wanted them to remember that only He is their help and salvation. I know that Jesus paid for my sin and cleansed me. I can warn others that they are in danger if they don‚Äôt believe in Jesus.
		
	</p><p>23:26-32 Day of Atonement. Jesus cleanses me from sin. He became a sacrifice for me. He is my righteousness.
		
	</p><p>23:33-36 Feast of Booths: He is my provision. God took care of His people when they traveled in the wilderness. They didn‚Äôt live in houses, but in tents. Every day, He gave them everything that they needed. Jesus also provides for my needs. I can remember that even though I live here (in a house or an apartment), Jesus is preparing a heavenly dwelling for me and one day, I will live there in heaven with Him!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>

I can‚Äôt do lots of good things in order to get rest from God or earn forgiveness and grace from Him. Salvation is God‚Äôs gift of grace through faith in Jesus! This is good news!\n\n  *Jesus is the fulfillment of these celebrations:\n  23:3 The Sabbath: He is our rest. God wanted people to rest from physical labor in order to teach them that Jesus gives spiritual rest to believers in Him (Heb 4:8-11).\n  23:4-8 The Passover: He is our freedom and redemption. Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (Jn. 1:29).\n  23:9-14 The Firstfruits: He is the firstborn from the dead (1 Cor. 15:20). He is the first fruit of our salvation.\n  23:15-21 Feast of Weeks or Pentecost: He gives us a ‚Äúharvest‚Äù (see Acts. 2). On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon believers in Jesus, they shared with the people about Jesus and many people were saved. All the people who became believers were like a spiritual ‚Äúharvest‚Äù.\n  23:23-25 Feast of Trumpets: He is our Help. People blew the trumpets as a warning. The sound reminded them that their sin separated them from God and that they need redemption and cleansing. God wanted them to remember that only He is their help and salvation. I know that Jesus paid for my sin and cleansed me. I can warn others that they are in danger if they don‚Äôt believe in Jesus.\n  23:26-32 Day of Atonement. Jesus cleanses me from sin. He became a sacrifice for me. He is my righteousness.\n  23:33-36 Feast of Booths: He is my provision. God took care of His people when they traveled in the wilderness. They didn‚Äôt live in houses, but in tents. Every day, He gave them everything that they needed. Jesus also provides for my needs. I can remember that even though I live here (in a house or an apartment), Jesus is preparing a heavenly dwelling for me and one day, I will live there in heaven with Him!\n"}</script></div>
