</h3>
		<p>God gave people instructions about 5 different sacrifices. When the people of Israel sinned with their words or actions, God wanted them to bring different sacrifices to the tabernacle.

He did this once for all when He offered Himself.‚Äù</p><p>Heb.  9:12 ‚ÄúHe entered the most holy place once for all, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.‚Äù</p><p>Heb  10:10 ‚ÄúBy this will of God, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all.‚Äù</p><p>1 Pet. 3:18 ‚ÄúFor Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God, after being put to death in the fleshly realm but made alive in the spiritual realm‚Äù</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God wanted His people to be holy, that is, separate from others. They were called to live differently than the other people on earth. They were called to love God. Their lifestyle was suppose to show others the love of God. Sin (when we don‚Äôt love God) leads to death. The blood of an animal was poured out in place of the blood of the sinner. When they saw the blood of the animal, they remembered that their sin leads to death and that they needed forgiveness from God for their sin.
		
	</p><p>Only Jesus can cleanse me and make me holy (sanctified, pure, clean). Only Jesus can help me to love God and live pleasing to Him. God wants me to love Him and His ways so that I would live different from the world (so my lifestyle wouldn‚Äôt be worldly) and for God (be like Jesus). Praise God that Jesus became the sacrifice for all my sins and I don‚Äôt need to bring different sacrifices and keep different rules for God to receive me. God received the sacrifice of Jesus because Jesus is fully God and fully  human. Only Jesus is sinless. Jesus, I trust You and Your righteousness. Cleanse my heart and give me love for God and others. Help me to live for You. You are Worthy. Receive my ‚Äúsacrifice‚Äù of dying to my selfish desires. I want to live for your loving purposes (Rom 12:1-2, ‚ÄúTherefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, I urge you to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will of God.‚Äù  2 Cor. 5:17 ‚ÄúTherefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away, and look, new things  have come.‚Äù).
		
	</p><p>*Jesus is the One who fulfilled every sacrifice for us, but it‚Äôs interesting that the fellowship offering was a sacrifice for fellowship with God. When Jesus ate with His disciples before His crucifixion and gave the disciples the bread and wine as a symbol of His body (communion), He showed that He is the only sacrifice for our sin and guilt but also that He gives us fellowship with God.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
