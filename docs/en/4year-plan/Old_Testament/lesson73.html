	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 1: King Ahaziah of Israel fell and wanted to find out his fate from a false god but God sent news to him through Elijah that he would die. The king sent 50 soldiers to go get Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill. They commanded him to come down. Elijah said, ‚Äú‚ÄúIf I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your 50 men.‚Äù Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his 50 men‚Äù (v.10). This happened a second time. The third time, the soldiers asked for mercy and God told Elijah to go down with them. Elijah told the king that he would die because he didn‚Äôt believe in the Living God.  According to God‚Äôs Word, it happened. Elijah wrote a letter to King Jehoram in Judah (son of Jehoshaphat) to tell him that because he acted wickedly, he would get sick and die (2 Chron. 21:1-20).</p><p>Ch 2: God was going to take Elijah to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah traveled to different cities and wanted to leave Elisha but Elisha wanted to stay with him. Many of God‚Äôs prophets said goodbye to Elijah, knowing that God would take him to Himself. Elijah and Elisha miraculously crossed the Jordan river. Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him before he left. He said that he wanted a double portion of his spirit. Elijah answered that if he saw him when he was taken, that it would be so. As they were walking together suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and took Elijah up in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it and cried out ‚Äúmy father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel‚Äù Then Elisha crossed over the river in a miraculous way again and the other prophets saw that the spirit of God was upon Elisha. They searched for Elijah for 3 days even though Elisha said that it was useless.</p><p>Ch. 3: King Joram (also spelled Jehoram) of Israel wanted to fight along with the king of Judah (at the time Jehoshaphat was still king) and the king of Edom against Moab. They were in the desert for 7 days and couldn‚Äôt find water. They thought that they would die. The king of Judah wanted to know God‚Äôs will for them and asked Elisha the prophet to ask God. A musician played music and God said that He would give them water and victory over Moab. In the morning, God gave them water. From far away, the sun on the water looked like blood and the Moabite king thought that the armies of the 3 other kings had killed each other. They came to the camp of the 3 kings and fought, but God gave the 3 kings victory over Moab.</p><p>Ch. 4: The Holy Spirit was upon Elisha. Once, a widow asked him for help. She needed money to pay a debt so that her children wouldn‚Äôt be sold into slavery. Elisha told her to find as many jars and containers as she could. She found many. Then the prophet told her to pour oil into them. The oil</p><p>miraculously kept flowing until the last jar was filled. Then the widow sold the oil to pay her debt.</p><p>Elisha went to a city where a certain family often helped him. He asked God to give them a child. After a few years, the boy got sick and died. The mother traveled to Elisha but didn‚Äôt say that her son had died. Elisha quickly came to the boy and prayed that God would return his life. Several times, he prayed and God gave the boy life! God raised him from the dead.</p><p>Elisha was with other prophets and their food was inedible. He put some flour in it and then everyone could eat it. One man brought 20 loaves of bread to the  group of 100 prophets. God did a miracle and when they ate, everyone there had enough to eat and there was bread left over.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Only God knows everything (false gods and people don‚Äôt know) and I can ask Him for wisdom and knowledge and pray to Him. Jesus protects me from evil. When I believe in Jesus, I know that he will take me to be with Him in heaven. I believe that God knows my needs and hears my prayers. I can ask God for help. He cares for my needs. I can ask Jesus to help the needs of others.
		
	</p><p>Earlier, Elijah had been so discouraged that he asked God to take his life. He wanted to die. But God had a better plan for Elijah‚Äôs life. He took him up to heaven to be with Him! This is a good example of how we can be thankful when God doesn‚Äôt always give us what we ask for!
		
	</p><p>Before Elijah was taken up to God, Elisha asked for God‚Äôs Spirit to be upon him (2 Kings 2:9). God answered his prayer and did many miracles through Elisha. Through these miracles, God blessed and cared for people in amazing ways. God can use ordinary things (flour and oil) and ordinary people (Elisha, you and me) for His glory, so that people would see that He is great! Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to believers to help them love God and tell others about Him. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit and to be glorified in my life (Lk.11:13).
		
	</p><p>God raised the boy from the dead. This reminds me of Jesus. Jesus brings life from death. He rose from the dead and He gives life to those who are dead in sin and promises to raise believers from the dead (Rom.8:11). That is  great miracle! He showed His great love for us when He died for us, so that we can have life in Him.  There are many people around me who are spiritually dead. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to tell them about the life that you can give them!</em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>Scriptures for further discussion about God taking us to be with Him and being with Jesus in heaven:
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>1 Thess. 4:13-18‚Äù But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.‚Äù
		
	</p><p>Rev 22:4 ‚ÄùThey shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads‚Äù
		
	</p><p>Job 19:25-27 ‚ÄùFor I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; 26 and  after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God, 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!‚Äù

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

Elijah traveled to different cities and wanted to leave Elisha but Elisha wanted to stay with him. Many of God‚Äôs prophets said goodbye to Elijah, knowing that God would take him to Himself. Elijah and Elisha miraculously crossed the Jordan river. Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him before he left. He said that he wanted a double portion of his spirit. Elijah answered that if he saw him when he was taken, that it would be so. As they were walking together suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and took Elijah up in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it and cried out ‚Äúmy father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel‚Äù Then Elisha crossed over the river in a miraculous way again and the other prophets saw that the spirit of God was upon Elisha. They searched for Elijah for 3 days even though Elisha said that it was useless.\n  Ch. 3: King Joram (also spelled Jehoram) of Israel wanted to fight along with the king of Judah (at the time Jehoshaphat was still king) and the king of Edom against Moab. They were in the desert for 7 days and couldn‚Äôt find water. They thought that they would die. The king of Judah wanted to know God‚Äôs will for them and asked Elisha the prophet to ask God. A musician played music and God said that He would give them water and victory over Moab. In the morning, God gave them water. From far away, the sun on the water looked like blood and the Moabite king thought that the armies of the 3 other kings had killed each other. They came to the camp of the 3 kings and fought, but God gave the 3 kings victory over Moab.\n  Ch. 4: The Holy Spirit was upon Elisha. Once, a widow asked him for help. She needed money to pay a debt so that her children wouldn‚Äôt be sold into slavery. Elisha told her to find as many jars and containers as she could. She found many. Then the prophet told her to pour oil into them. The oil\n  miraculously kept flowing until the last jar was filled. Then the widow sold the oil to pay her debt.\n  Elisha went to a city where a certain family often helped him. He asked God to give them a child. After a few years, the boy got sick and died. The mother traveled to Elisha but didn‚Äôt say that her son had died. Elisha quickly came to the boy and prayed that God would return his life. Several times, he prayed and God gave the boy life! God raised him from the dead.\n  Elisha was with other prophets and their food was inedible. He put some flour in it and then everyone could eat it. One man brought 20 loaves of bread to the  group of 100 prophets. God did a miracle and when they ate, everyone there had enough to eat and there was bread left over.\n\nCharacter:\n- God knows everything\n- He sees all\n- He is caring\n- He is everywhere (omnipresent)\n- God controls history\n- God has a plan to take His own to be with Him\n- God is Holy Spirit\n- God is mighty\n- God has all authority\n- God protects\n- God is the Only God\n- God provides\n- He is a God of miracles\n- He is wonderful\n- He hears our prayers\n- God loves to do the impossible\n- He is glorious\n- He is caring\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He is the Victor\nApplication: |\n  Only God knows everything (false gods and people don‚Äôt know) and I can ask Him for wisdom and knowledge and pray to Him. Jesus protects me from evil. When I believe in Jesus, I know that he will take me to be with Him in heaven. I believe that God knows my needs and hears my prayers. I can ask God for help. He cares for my needs. I can ask Jesus to help the needs of others.\n  Earlier, Elijah had been so discouraged that he asked God to take his life. He wanted to die. But God had a better plan for Elijah‚Äôs life. He took him up to heaven to be with Him! This is a good example of how we can be thankful when God doesn‚Äôt always give us what we ask for!\n  Before Elijah was taken up to God, Elisha asked for God‚Äôs Spirit to be upon him (2 Kings 2:9). God answered his prayer and did many miracles through Elisha. Through these miracles, God blessed and cared for people in amazing ways. God can use ordinary things (flour and oil) and ordinary people (Elisha, you and me) for His glory, so that people would see that He is great! Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to believers to help them love God and tell others about Him. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit and to be glorified in my life (Lk.11:13).\n  God raised the boy from the dead. This reminds me of Jesus. Jesus brings life from death. He rose from the dead and He gives life to those who are dead in sin and promises to raise believers from the dead (Rom.8:11). That is  great miracle! He showed His great love for us when He died for us, so that we can have life in Him.  There are many people around me who are spiritually dead. __Jesus, help me to tell them about the life that you can give them!__\n\n  Scriptures for further discussion about God taking us to be with Him and being with Jesus in heaven:\n\n  1 Thess. 4:13-18‚Äù But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.‚Äù\n  Rev 22:4 ‚ÄùThey shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads‚Äù\n  Job 19:25-27 ‚ÄùFor I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; 26 and  after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God, 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!‚Äù\n"}</script></div>
