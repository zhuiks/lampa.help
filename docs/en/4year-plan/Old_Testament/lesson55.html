	Application
</h3>
		<p>It‚Äôs amazing how many psalms speak of Jesus. I believe that Jesus is God and that God had a plan from eternity to send Jesus to earth to die for my sin and to rise again. 1 Pet. 1:20-21 says, ‚ÄúHe was chosen before the foundation of the world but was revealed at the end of the times for you 21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.‚Äù I believe that the whole Bible is true and speaks of God‚Äôs plan of salvation for people through faith in Jesus. I believe that Jesus is King and that He reigns now in heaven (and in the hearts of those who love Him). One day, He will return and will reign on earth. I want Him to be King of my heart and of my life today and forever. I want to tell my friends and relatives about salvation in Jesus. I want to pray for those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus, that He would become their king.
		
	</p><p>*note Messiah means anointed one. Kings were often anointed with oil to show that they were chosen to reign.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
