	Application
</h3>
		<p>God was faithful to warn the people and call them to repentance. He is also faithful to speak to me through His Word. The people didn‚Äôt want to hear God‚Äôs Word and called Jeremiah a liar Jesus, help me to believe and follow Your Word. Jeremiah suffered at the hands of evil people who didn‚Äôt believe God‚Äôs Word but God helped Him just as He promised. Maybe some people also treat me poorly because I believe in Jesus and talk about Him. But I know that Jesus is always with me. He is my help. Jesus even said ‚ÄúYou are blessed when they insult and persecute you and falsely say every kind of evil against you because of Me. 12 Be glad and rejoice, because your reward is great in heaven. For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you ‚Äú (Matt. 5:11-12).
		
	</p><p>Jeremiah knew that God is the most important and that He is worthy of his obedience. I also believe that Jesus is the most important and He is worthy of my obedience. He gave His life for me and forgives my sin. I know that He loves me and I love Him! In Lamentations 3:24, Jeremiah said that God is His portion and that he put his hope in HIm. Even when Jeremiah‚Äôs homeland was destroyed and he was taken away to Egypt, he knew that God was his portion and hope. This world changes all the time, but God‚Äôs kingdom is eternal and He has a reward, a portion, an inheritance and a place prepared for all those who love Jesus. We have a living hope (1Pet. 1:3) in Christ Jesus. We are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Heb. 12:28) and are looking ahead for the city that endures (Heb. 13:14 ), the New Jerusalem, where we will be with Jesus forever.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

In Lamentations 3:24, Jeremiah said that God is His portion and that he put his hope in HIm. Even when Jeremiah‚Äôs homeland was destroyed and he was taken away to Egypt, he knew that God was his portion and hope. This world changes all the time, but God‚Äôs kingdom is eternal and He has a reward, a portion, an inheritance and a place prepared for all those who love Jesus. We have a living hope (1Pet. 1:3) in Christ Jesus. We are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken (Heb. 12:28) and are looking ahead for the city that endures (Heb. 13:14 ), the New Jerusalem, where we will be with Jesus forever.\n"}</script></div>
