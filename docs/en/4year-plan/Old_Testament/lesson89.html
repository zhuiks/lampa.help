	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 4: God gave king Nebuchadnezzar a dream to warn him to be humble before God. The Holy Spirit gave Daniel understanding of the meaning of the king‚Äôs dream. Daniel told the king that he should repent (that is stop acting his own way and start going God‚Äôs way). In time, the king forgot about the dream and was proud. God humbled him for a time, until he understood that God is the most important (v. 22-23 ). Later, the king praised God and understood that He can humble the proud and that God is right in all that He does (v. 34).</p><p>Then Belshazzar saw a hand (and only a hand!) which wrote mysterious words (a riddle) on the wall. The king was very frightened and promised to rewards the person who could explain the riddle. God helped Daniel to understand the words and explain them to Belshazzar. He told him that although Belshazzar knew what happened with Nebuchadnezzar (when God humbled him), he didn‚Äôt learn from the example and decided to exalt himself  before God (v.20-23). God told Belshazzar through the words on the wall that He was not pleased with Him and that He would take the kingdom from him. That very night, God did as He said. Belshazzar was killed and Darius the Mede became ruler of the kingdom.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God saw that Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs heart was inclined towards pride and in His mercy, warned him to be humble. God explained this to him though his humble servant, Daniel. God also warns me through His Word to repent and live His way. Nebuchadnezzar forgot God‚Äôs Word and started to think that he was the most important. I also forget, and this is why it‚Äôs important to abide in the Word every day. Jesus, give me a desire to read the Bible and teach me when I read it. God humbled the king until he admitted that God has all authority. Even though I may not like it, it‚Äôs good when God humbles me. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Help me, Lord, to understand that You are the greatest and most important.</em>
	</p><p>Belshazzar didn‚Äôt learn from Nebuchadnezzar‚Äôs example. He didn‚Äôt fear (respect/honor/reverence) God and that‚Äôs why God took the kingdom from him. God can take something from me to teach me to respect Him. He sees my heart and knows everything. Jesus, give me a heart that loves You, respects You and knows that You are the greatest. Daniel trusted God and always gave God the glory. The Holy Spirit gave him wisdom. The Holy Spirit can give me wisdom. Through Daniel, God told people that He is the most important and the greatest. God, fill me with Your Holy Spirit and help me to tell people that Jesus is the most important and the greatest.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
