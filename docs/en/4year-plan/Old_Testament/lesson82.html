	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Is. 52:13-15 and Ch. 53: The suffering servant paid for the sins of many. Detailed description of the Messiah‚Äôs suffering, death, burial and resurrection.</p><p>54-66: God has a special plan for Israel, but in these chapters, He describes saving nations that didn‚Äôt know Him before. God promises that His people will be with Him (during the 1,000 year reign). A glorious future awaits those who believe in the Messiah, but eternal punishment awaits those who don‚Äôt believe in Him.</p><p></p><p>Is. 54:14 ‚Äúand you will be established on a foundation of righteousness. You will be far from oppression, you will certainly not be afraid; you will be far from terror, it will certainly not come near you.‚Äù</p><p>55:1 God offers salvation freely. God also says that His thoughts are higher than ours (v.8-9). ‚ÄúSo My word that comes from My mouth will not return to Me empty, but it will accomplish what I please and will prosper in what I send it to do‚Äù (v.11)</p><p>56:7 God promises to save the Gentiles who follow Him. ‚ÄúI will bring them to My holy mountain</p><p>and let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar, for My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations.‚Äù</p><p>57:15 ‚ÄúFor the High and Exalted One who lives forever, whose name is Holy says this: ‚ÄúI live in a high and holy place, and with the oppressed and lowly of spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and revive the heart of the oppressed.‚Äù</p><p>Ch. 58: God says that the  fast which pleases Him is when a person stops living their own way and starts living God‚Äôs way. Verse 3 says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶Look, you do as you please on the day of your fast, and oppress all your workers.‚Äù Verse 6 says,‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt the fast I choose: To break the chains of wickedness, to untie the ropes of the yoke, to set the oppressed free, and to tear off every yoke?</p><p>Ch. 59: Our sin separates us from God (v. 1-2). God Himself accomplishes our salvation (16-21).</p><p>Ch. 60: God promises to revive Israel. Many peoples will come to God through Israel. One day, believers will be in God‚Äôs presence in heaven. ‚ÄúThe sun will no longer be your light by day, and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you; but the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor. 20 Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not fade; for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will be over.‚Äù</p><p>Ch. 61: See Luke 4:17-22 when Jesus read and fulfilled these words from verses 1-2. God gives us His righteousness (v. 10).</p><p>Ch. 62: God compares believers to a bride (v. 5). He promises to save and redeem Jerusalem.</p><p>Ch. 63: God will judge the nations. He punished Israel for their faithlessness but Isaiah remembers that God is Father and Redeemer (v. 16).</p><p>Ch. 64: Isaiah prays for God‚Äôs mercy and remembers God‚Äôs character. ‚ÄúFrom ancient times no one has heard, no one has listened, no eye has seen any God except You, who acts on behalf of the one who waits for Him.‚Äù (v.4)</p><p>Ch. 65: A description of heaven (v. 17-18) and  the 1,000 year reign of the Messiah on earth (v. 19-25).</p><p>Ch. 66:2 ‚ÄúMy hand made all these things, and so they all came into being. This is the Lord‚Äôs declaration. I will look favorably on this kind of person: one who is humble, submissive  in spirit,</p><p>and trembles at My word.‚Äù</p><p>God speaks of judgement upon non-believers and of glory that awaits believers. *Prophecy about Israel becoming a nation (v. 7-9).</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I believe that the Word of God is the truth and that Jesus is coming. He will judge the world. He will reign on earth for 1,000 years. I also believe that all believers will live with Jesus in heaven where there is eternal joy in the presence of Jesus! Now, I want to live for Jesus, follow Him and tell people about Him. Only Jesus gives me full forgiveness, true life, lasting joy and meaning for life. Jesus is my Redeemer and He changes my life. Knowing what a hope I have in Christ, I want to love Jesus more and praise Him with my life!

	</p><p>*Here is the prophecy that God already fulfilled when Israel became a nation in 1948 (Is. 66:7-9).

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

God Himself accomplishes our salvation (16-21).\n  Ch. 60: God promises to revive Israel. Many peoples will come to God through Israel. One day, believers will be in God‚Äôs presence in heaven. ‚ÄúThe sun will no longer be your light by day, and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you; but the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor. 20 Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not fade; for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will be over.‚Äù\n  Ch. 61: See Luke 4:17-22 when Jesus read and fulfilled these words from verses 1-2. God gives us His righteousness (v. 10).\n  Ch. 62: God compares believers to a bride (v. 5). He promises to save and redeem Jerusalem.\n  Ch. 63: God will judge the nations. He punished Israel for their faithlessness but Isaiah remembers that God is Father and Redeemer (v. 16).\n  Ch. 64: Isaiah prays for God‚Äôs mercy and remembers God‚Äôs character. ‚ÄúFrom ancient times no one has heard, no one has listened, no eye has seen any God except You, who acts on behalf of the one who waits for Him.‚Äù (v.4)\n  Ch. 65: A description of heaven (v. 17-18) and  the 1,000 year reign of the Messiah on earth (v. 19-25).\n  Ch. 66:2 ‚ÄúMy hand made all these things, and so they all came into being. This is the Lord‚Äôs declaration. I will look favorably on this kind of person: one who is humble, submissive  in spirit,\n  and trembles at My word.‚Äù\n  God speaks of judgement upon non-believers and of glory that awaits believers. *Prophecy about Israel becoming a nation (v. 7-9).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Messiah\n- God fulfilled and fulfills His Words of prophecy\n- God is Loving\n- God pours out wrath on unbelievers and pours out mercy on believers\n- God is glorious\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- Jesus is Life\nApplication: |\n  I believe that the Word of God is the truth and that Jesus is coming. He will judge the world. He will reign on earth for 1,000 years. I also believe that all believers will live with Jesus in heaven where there is eternal joy in the presence of Jesus! Now, I want to live for Jesus, follow Him and tell people about Him. Only Jesus gives me full forgiveness, true life, lasting joy and meaning for life. Jesus is my Redeemer and He changes my life. Knowing what a hope I have in Christ, I want to love Jesus more and praise Him with my life!\n\n  *Here is the prophecy that God already fulfilled when Israel became a nation in 1948 (Is. 66:7-9).\n"}</script></div>
