	Application
</h3>
		<p>I know that God shows me mercy. He sent Jesus, who died for me and forgives my sin when I trust in Him. Every day and every minute, he shows me mercy, love and care. I can praise Him and be thankful. I can show others mercy so that they would know about Jesus‚Äô love. Just as David kept his work and helped the son of Jonathan, I know that God keeps His Word to save me and help me. Jesus helps me to keep my word when I promise to do something.
		
	</p><p>God gave David and Israel victory over their enemies when they followed Him. Jesus wants to give me victory over sin that is my ‚Äúenemy‚Äù in my life. Maybe that ‚Äúenemy‚Äù is a bad habit or a harmful desire. When I seek Jesus and ask Him for help, He gives me strength to stand against sin and act God‚Äôs way (which is pleasing to Him.)

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
