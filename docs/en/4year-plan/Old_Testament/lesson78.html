	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Azariah was king in Judah after his father. He followed God and God also gave him success and victory over his enemies. But later, he became proud and decided to go into the temple and do what only the priests were suppose to do. God punished him with a sickness.</p><p>2 Chron. 27: After Azariah, his son Joram reigned. He loved God and did what was right in the eyes of God. God blessed him.</p><p>2 Kings ch. 15: When King Azariah (also called Uzziah) reigned in Judah. In Israel, there were many different king who did what was evil in God‚Äôs sight. According to God‚Äôs Word spoken through the prophets, He sent the Assyrian king to fight against Israel, conquer them, take their cities and lead them away captive. ‚ÄúIn the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee‚Äîall the land of Naphtali‚Äîand deported the people to Assyria‚Äù (15:29). At this time, Uzziah‚Äôs son, Jotham reigned in Judah.</p><p>2 Kings 16: King Ahaz reigned after his father, Jotham. Syria and Israel attacked Jerusalem but didn‚Äôt conquer it. Ahaz paid the king of Assyria (Tiglath-pileser) to fight against Syria and he did. Ahaz had a new altar built and offered sacrifices on it.</p><p>Ch. 28: Ahaz didn‚Äôt love God and did evil in God‚Äôs sight. Ahaz decided to close up God‚Äôs temple and put idols throughout Jerusalem. This made God angry. ‚ÄúAt the time of his distress, King Ahaz himself became more unfaithful to the Lord‚Äù (v.22).</p><p>2 Kings 17: Hosea reigned in Israel. They paid money to Assyria but then rebelled. ‚ÄúThen the king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria. He deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, Gozan‚Äôs river, and in the cities of the Medes‚Äù (v. 5-6). The were exiled because they had sinned against the Lord, worshipped idols and did not listen to God‚Äôs Word through the prophets. ‚ÄúEven Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced‚Äú (v. 19).</p><p>The Assyrian king relocated other nations to the land of Israel (17:24). God sent lions that attacked people. This caused them to ask a priest to teach them how to fear the Lord (v. 28). These different nations worshiped their false gods along with the Lord God in the land of Israel.</p><p>Isaiah 1-6: Isaiah was in the southern kingdom of Judah. God told His people that they were spiritually unhealthy, and that He wanted to heal and forgive their sin. He warned them that He would punish them to show them that their godless ways were dangerous and led to death. In Chapter 6, Isaiah sees a vision of God‚Äôs throne. God cleanses his sin and calls Isaiah to be His prophet.</p><p>Is. ch 7-14: Isaiah prophesied these words at the time of king Ahaz in Judah. God warned him of the coming wrath and also prophesied about the Messiah. God offered to give Ahaz a sign, but Ahaz didn‚Äôt want to ask of God. ‚ÄúTherefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel‚Äù (7:14).</p><p>Micah: Micah spoke God‚Äôs word to Samaria (the capitol of the northern kingdom, Israel) and to Jerusalem (the capitol of the southern kingdom, Judah). God through Micah said that He would judge them (see 3:1-2, 11-12). But God also spoke words of comfort and hope. He said that a Savior would come (5:2). God told the people, ‚ÄúMankind, He has told you what is good and what it is the Lord requires of you: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God.‚Äù (6:8). Micah was a good example of following God. He said ‚ÄúBut I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.‚Äù (7:7)</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>God wants me to worship Him alone. He wants to have the first place in my life. It‚Äôs dangerous when I love to live my own way. When I ask Jesus to help me, He gives me strength to live right and to love God and others. God‚Äôs discipline shows me that if I don‚Äôt love Jesus, things will be hard and painful for me. Jesus can give me a heart that loves God and others. Idols are anything that we love more than God. Only Jesus is worthy of our worship. Worship is when we really love and value something or someone and do everything to please them. Worship is when we consider something to be most important to us. My desires can be idols if I consider them to be more important that Jesus and His will for me.
		
	</p><p>God sent His prophets to speak the Truth to His people at a time when they weren‚Äôt reading the Word or hearing the truth. He was faithful to make sure they knew who He was and what He was doing. Even when He punished their sin, He gave them words of comfort and promises of the Savior, Jesus.  In Isaiah 7:14,  it says that Jesus is Emmanuel which means ‚ÄúGod with us.‚Äù I know that Jesus is the only Savior and that He is with me always. I want to worship Him alone.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Thank you God for your faithfulness and love towards me. Help me to love you above all and worship You alone.</em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>About the prophets:
		
	</p><p>God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here.

At this time, Uzziah‚Äôs son, Jotham reigned in Judah.\n  2 Kings 16: King Ahaz reigned after his father, Jotham. Syria and Israel attacked Jerusalem but didn‚Äôt conquer it. Ahaz paid the king of Assyria (Tiglath-pileser) to fight against Syria and he did. Ahaz had a new altar built and offered sacrifices on it.\n  Ch. 28: Ahaz didn‚Äôt love God and did evil in God‚Äôs sight. Ahaz decided to close up God‚Äôs temple and put idols throughout Jerusalem. This made God angry. ‚ÄúAt the time of his distress, King Ahaz himself became more unfaithful to the Lord‚Äù (v.22).\n  2 Kings 17: Hosea reigned in Israel. They paid money to Assyria but then rebelled. ‚ÄúThen the king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria. He deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah and by the Habor, Gozan‚Äôs river, and in the cities of the Medes‚Äù (v. 5-6). The were exiled because they had sinned against the Lord, worshipped idols and did not listen to God‚Äôs Word through the prophets. ‚ÄúEven Judah did not keep the commands of the Lord their God but lived according to the customs Israel had introduced‚Äú (v. 19).\n  The Assyrian king relocated other nations to the land of Israel (17:24). God sent lions that attacked people. This caused them to ask a priest to teach them how to fear the Lord (v. 28). These different nations worshiped their false gods along with the Lord God in the land of Israel.\n  Isaiah 1-6: Isaiah was in the southern kingdom of Judah. God told His people that they were spiritually unhealthy, and that He wanted to heal and forgive their sin. He warned them that He would punish them to show them that their godless ways were dangerous and led to death. In Chapter 6, Isaiah sees a vision of God‚Äôs throne. God cleanses his sin and calls Isaiah to be His prophet.\n  Is. ch 7-14: Isaiah prophesied these words at the time of king Ahaz in Judah. God warned him of the coming wrath and also prophesied about the Messiah. God offered to give Ahaz a sign, but Ahaz didn‚Äôt want to ask of God. ‚ÄúTherefore, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive, have a son, and name him Immanuel‚Äù (7:14).\n  Micah: Micah spoke God‚Äôs word to Samaria (the capitol of the northern kingdom, Israel) and to Jerusalem (the capitol of the southern kingdom, Judah). God through Micah said that He would judge them (see 3:1-2, 11-12). But God also spoke words of comfort and hope. He said that a Savior would come (5:2). God told the people, ‚ÄúMankind, He has told you what is good and what it is the Lord requires of you: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with your God.‚Äù (6:8). Micah was a good example of following God. He said ‚ÄúBut I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.‚Äù (7:7)\n\nCharacter:\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- God is holy\n- He is pure\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He punishes evil\n- He is ready to forgive and cleanse\n- Jesus is Immanuel, God with us\nApplication: |\n  God wants me to worship Him alone. He wants to have the first place in my life. It‚Äôs dangerous when I love to live my own way. When I ask Jesus to help me, He gives me strength to live right and to love God and others. God‚Äôs discipline shows me that if I don‚Äôt love Jesus, things will be hard and painful for me. Jesus can give me a heart that loves God and others. Idols are anything that we love more than God. Only Jesus is worthy of our worship. Worship is when we really love and value something or someone and do everything to please them. Worship is when we consider something to be most important to us. My desires can be idols if I consider them to be more important that Jesus and His will for me.\n  God sent His prophets to speak the Truth to His people at a time when they weren‚Äôt reading the Word or hearing the truth. He was faithful to make sure they knew who He was and what He was doing. Even when He punished their sin, He gave them words of comfort and promises of the Savior, Jesus.  In Isaiah 7:14,  it says that Jesus is Emmanuel which means ‚ÄúGod with us.‚Äù I know that Jesus is the only Savior and that He is with me always. I want to worship Him alone.__Thank you God for your faithfulness and love towards me. Help me to love you above all and worship You alone.__\n\n  About the prophets:\n  God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.\n"}</script></div>
