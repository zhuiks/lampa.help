	Summary

		<p>God told His people in Babylon through Ezekiel that they were taken into captivity because of their sin. God wanted them to return to Him. Ezekiel  told them that they would still be in Babylon for a long time before they returned to the land of Israel. But he also said that God promised them a good future in the land, where there would be a united and not divided kingdom.</p><p></p><p>God spoke judgement against different nations, including Egypt (ch.29-32)</p><p>God called Ezekiel His watchman to pass on words of warning to Israel, such as:‚ÄúTell them: As I live‚Äù‚Äîthe declaration of the Lord God‚Äî‚ÄúI take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked person should turn from his way and live. Repent, repent of your evil ways! Why will you die, house of Israel?‚Äù (33:11). God said that Israel‚Äôs leaders were like bad shepherds who didn‚Äôt care for the sheep. He promised to care for the people as a good shepherd and to give them a King who will care for them and be a Good Shepherd to them (34:11-31). God promised to cleanse the people from sin and give them a new heart and a new spirit (36:26). He promised to bring them back to the land to rebuild and replant, so that they would know that He is the Lord (36:36-38).</p><p></p><p>God also showed him dry bones and gave them life in order to explain that He brings life to people (37:1-14). ‚ÄúI will put My Spirit in you, and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. I have spoken, and I will do it.‚Äù This is the declaration of the Lord.‚Äù (37:14).</p><p>Ch. 40-48: Ezekiel is shown a vision of the new temple. He sees the glory of the Lord return there. He is shown a gate for the Prince and given instructions for the priests. He sees water flowing from the temple. God tells him where each tribe should live and details about the city gates. Verse 35 says that</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶the name of the city from that day on will be: Yahweh Is There.‚Äù</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God spoke to Ezekiel and showed him many amazing visions of His glory and His plans for people. God also speaks to me through the Bible about His plans for me and other people. When I read about Him, I remember that He is worthy of worship.
		
	</p><p>Israel fell into captivity because of their sin but God was merciful to them and later brought them back to the land. When I live my own way and sin, things are bad for me and I distance myself from God. But when I ask Jesus for forgiveness, He cleanses my heart and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. Without God, people are like dry bones but Jesus gives eternal life! Just as He promised in His Word, God returned His people to the land of Israel and they were one kingdom again. Also, just as God promised, He sent Jesus who is King and the Good Shepherd for Israel and for all who trust Him. Now, Jesus reigns in heaven and rules in the hearts of believers. Soon, He will come to earth again and will reign here so that all would know that He is King. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please help me to tell people now that You are the Eternal King and the Good Shepherd. Help me to invite people to come to church or to read the Bible with me so that they could know You.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
