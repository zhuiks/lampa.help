	Application
</h3>
		<p>In Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the law and reminds people of what God did and said to them. There is a saying ‚Äúrepetition is the mother of learning.‚Äù It‚Äôs useful for me to read God‚Äôs Word and remember: what God tells me, what Jesus did for me, how He provides for and cares for me, what He promises me, why it‚Äôs dangerous to forget about God. I can ask Jesus to help me to read the Bible and remember what I read. He helps me to be obedient to God. He gives me His Holy Spirit that gives me strength to follow Jesus and trust Him. He helps me to love God and others.
		
	</p><p>God chose Israel to be His special people and He loves them (Deut. 4:37, 7:6-7,10:15).  God also loves me and desires me to know His love and to love Him. He is worthy! Jesus, help me to love you more and more and to trust you and your Word. Your Word says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord‚Äù (Deut. 8:3). Jesus quoted this verse  when He was tempted (see Luke 4).
		
	</p><p>In Deut. 18:15-22, God speaks about Jesus as the Prophet that the people should listen to. This is one of the many OT prophecies about Jesus. People waited many years for God to send the Messiah, Jesus. We know that He accomplished His saving work.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
