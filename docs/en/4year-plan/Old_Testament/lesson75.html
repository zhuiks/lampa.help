	Application
</h3>
		<p>The time came when God judged Ahab‚Äôs house for all their evil. They had done wicked things and didn‚Äôt follow God. God also spoke judgement against Edom for their pride. One day, God will punish all those who don‚Äôt love and follow Jesus. Often in Scripture, the day when God will judge everyone is called: The Day of the Lord. In the book of Joel alone, the phrase ‚Äúthe Day of the Lord‚Äù appears 5 times. When I believe in Jesus and trust Him, I don‚Äôt have to be afraid of punishment (1 Jn. 4:17-19). He took my punishment upon Himself on the cross. He takes away the sin of all those who trust in HIm. This is good news! 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, please help me to walk with you all of my days and to love you with all of my heart. Help me to tell others about you, to warn them about judgement and to tell them the good news, that You can take away their sin and guilt. Thank you for your faithful love and compassion. </em>
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>1 Jn. 4:17-19 ‚ÄúIn this, love is perfected with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, for we are as He is in this world. 18 There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear, because fear involves punishment. So the one who fears has not reached perfection in love. 19 We love because He first loved us.‚Äù
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>About the prophets:
		
	</p><p>God was faithful to send prophets to speak God‚Äôs Word of warning, rebuke, encouragement and comfort to the people. We know a lot about the prophets Elijah and Elisha from the Bible. Less is known about some of the other prophets. In the New Testament, it says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶you should know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from one‚Äôs own interpretation, 21 because no prophecy ever came by the will of man; instead, men spoke from God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit‚Äù (2 Pet. 1:20-21). In Acts 10:43, Peter says that, ‚ÄúAll the prophets testify about Him (Jesus) that through His name everyone who believes in Him will receive forgiveness of sins.‚Äù Reading the prophets can sometimes be like looking for hidden treasure. Truth about Jesus can be found in each of the books of prophecy. Often, the New Testament quotes words from the prophets and helps us to understand what was being said about Jesus. Best of all, God gives us His Holy Spirit to understand the truth of His Word and to love God more through it.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
