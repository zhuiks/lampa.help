	Summary
</h3>
		<p>When Jonathan saw David‚Äôs boldness, he gave him his armour as a gift and made a covenant of friendship with him. Saul kept David with him to serve him. People sang a song about how David was a great warrior and Saul was jealous of David (18:7). Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear. He made David a commander in the army and God was with David and helped him. Then Saul told David that he could marry his daughter if he killed 100 Philistines. He thought that the Philistines would kill David in battle, but David did what Saul wanted and became his son-in-law. Saul feared David because God was with him (18:12).</p><p>Saul wanted to kill David, but Jonathan convinced his father not to do it. Later, Saul wanted to kill David again and was watching his house, but David‚Äôs wife helped him to run away (Ps. 59). David went to Samuel. When Saul wanted to take David away, all the people that he sent to get him began prophesying (speaking God‚Äôs word) because the Holy Spirit came upon them (19:23).</p><p>David went to Jonathan and asked why Saul wanted to kill him. Jonathan had a plan to find out and later told David. Saul threw his spear at Jonathan and he knew that his father wanted to kill David. He was sad and told David that he should leave Saul. Jonathan and David promises to always be friends and to care for one another‚Äôs children (20:42).</p><p>Ch. 21-22: David ran to Nob, where there was a priest. He asked for the bread that usually only the priests are allowed to eat. David lied and said that he was doing the king‚Äôs business. The priest gave him the bread and Goliath‚Äôs sword which was there. One of Saul‚Äôs servants, Doeg saw everything.</p><p>David ran away further to the king of Gath (a pagan king). He regarded David as an enemy. Then David pretended to be crazy in order to run away from him (see Ps.34, 56). David left and lived far away from Saul (Ps. 63). His family and others gathered to him. Doeg told Saul that the priest helped David and so Saul killed the priest and his relatives (Ps. 52). One of them escaped to David and David promised to protect him.</p><p></p><p>see also Ps.7, 13, 20, 22, 27, 31, 34, 52, 56, 59</p><p>*Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not.

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God is faithful to me. He is my help and defence. Jesus is the most faithful friend. He showed His love when He died on the cross for my sins. He forgives my sin and gives me a new relationship with God. Through faith in Jesus, I can belong to God‚Äôs eternal family.
		
	</p><p>When God is most important to us and to our friendships (as in the example of Jonathan and David‚Äôs friendship), we can be a good support to one another. Jesus shows me how to love and support others.
		
	</p><p>Even when people don‚Äôt treat me well (as David experienced), I can know that God is with me and that He fulfills His good plan for my life. David was wrong when he answered the priest deceitfully. The priest suffered because of David‚Äôs lie. God, help me to trust You and to always answer honestly
		
	</p><p>Jealous and envy (as we saw in Saul) destroys friendship and brings pain to all those around. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, forgive me when I envy. Give me a pure heart and a right attitude. Help me to trust You because You are the most faithful friend.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
