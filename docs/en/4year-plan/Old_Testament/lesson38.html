	Summary
</h3>
		<p>The 40 years of punishment were finished. Moses had died. Joshua is the leader of Israel. God told him again and again not to fear, to be obedient and to take the land. God promises to be with him. God told the people to go into the promised land. A new group of spies went into the land and hid in the house of Rahab, in the city of Jericho. Rahab heard about God and believed that He is mighty. The spies promised to save her and her family if she would hang a red cord in her window, so they could remember which house was hers.</p><p>The Israelites were ready to cross over into the promised land and God told them to cross the Jordan river. God promised to stop the water when they stepped into the river so that they could safely cross over to the other side. And God did it! The people set up stones to remember what God did there.</p><p>God tells the new generation to be circumcised according to the law. The people celebrate Passover. They eat food from the land and stopped receiving manna.  Joshua meets the commander of the Lord‚Äôs army who tells him how to conquer the city.</p><p>Jericho was a huge city with big thick walls. God told the people to silently march around the city of Jericho once for 6 days and on the 7th day to march around the city 7 times and then to blow their trumpets. Then the walls around the city of Jericho came falling down!  God gave the city to the Israelites and the people saw that God is great and mighty. Rahab and her family were saved out of the city because she hung the red cord in her window.</p><p></p><p>see also Heb 11:30-31 ‚ÄúBy faith the walls of Jericho fell down after being encircled by the Israelites for seven days. 31 By faith Rahab the prostitute received the spies in peace and didn‚Äôt perish with those who disobeyed.‚Äù</p><p></p></section>

	<section><h3>
	Application
</h3>
		<p>God told the people to do something that seemed impossible. Jericho was a huge city with big thick walls but God was stronger than the walls! Even when something seems impossible, I know that with God nothing is impossible. I believe that God is powerful.  Rahab believed in God and put the red cord in her window. The red cord reminds me of the blood over the windows at Passover and of Jesus‚Äô blood. Just as God saved Rahab, He saves me when I believe that Jesus‚Äô paid for my sin with His blood.
		
	</p><p>Jesus is eternal and sometimes we read about Him in the Old Testament. Jesus is the commander of the Lord‚Äôs army. I believe that He will return to take believers to be with Him and to judge and punish the sinful world. I want to tell people about Jesus so that they would trust Him and not be judged by God. Jesus is mighty to save!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
