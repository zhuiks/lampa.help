	Application
</h3>
		<p>King David helped to set up and organize how God was worshipped musically. He used to play on his harp when he was a shepherd (1 Sam.16:19-23) and here he encouraged many others to praise God in song.  In the psalms, I see that creation and all people praise God. I can sing songs to God or play on an instrument or simply say that I love God. I can draw Him a picture or write a list of all the reason that I love Him. I can remember His great deeds, that He did during the Bible times and that He now does in my life and the lives of others. I praise God that He saved me. He is great and worthy of praise. When I‚Äôm sad or disappointed, I can remember who God is and praise Him for all that He has done, is doing and will do. Praise Jesus!!!

	</p><p>*Korah‚Äôs rebellion is detailed in Num. 16, when this Levite didn‚Äôt want to submit to God‚Äôs instructions on which of the Levites would serve the Lord in specific ways. All those who rebelled were punished by the Lord, but it‚Äôs wonderful to see that many generations later, the sons of Korah were joyfully praising the Lord in song and leading others in worship.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
