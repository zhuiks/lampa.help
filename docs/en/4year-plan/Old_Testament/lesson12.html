		<p>Chapt. 20: Abraham and Sarah went to the land of king Abimelech. Abraham was afraid that the king would kill him and take his wife. He hid the truth that they were husband and wife.

He returned her and asked him to leave his land.</p><p>Chapt. 21: According to God‚Äôs word, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. Ishmael mocked (made fun of) Isaac. Sarah wanted them to leave. ‚ÄúNow this was a very difficult thing for Abraham because of his son.But God said to Abraham, ‚ÄúDo not be concerned  about the boy and your slave. Whatever Sarah says to you, listen to her, because your offspring will be traced through Isaac. But I will also make a nation of the slave‚Äôs son because he is your offspring‚Äù (v.11-13). God took care of Hagar and Ishmael (v. 13, 19). See also Gal. 4:28-31.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Sometimes I may end up in a dangerous situation because of someone else‚Äôs decision. Sarah was in such a situation. God protected her in order to fulfill His plan and make her the mother of Isaac. God also can protect me in order to fulfill His plan for my life. Abraham was afraid of Abimelech and hid the truth. God wants me to fear Him alone and not people. I don‚Äôt need to hide anything. I can answer honestly and know that God is my help and defence!
		
	</p><p>Abraham sent Ishmael away. According to Gal. 4:21-31, the lives of Ishmael and Isaac teach us about living according to the flesh and living according to the Spirit. A life lived in the flesh, by my strength and works (as Ishmael‚Äôs birth was according to the flesh) can‚Äôt please God and can‚Äôt live peacefully alongside that which is from God and according to His Word (as Isaac‚Äôs birth was according to the  promise). I can‚Äôt live both my way and God‚Äôs way. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, thank you that You save my by grace and free me from sin and death. Help me to love you and rely upon You and the power of Your Holy Spirit in all things.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
