	Application
</h3>
		<p>God destroyed the cities of the evil people. I know that God will punish sin and that one day He will judge all unbelievers. Those who don‚Äôt love Jesus will go to hell where there is eternal torment. I don‚Äôt want anyone to go to hell and this is why I tell people about Jesus. Only He is Savior and can forgive sin and give us a new heart. Jesus promises to save all who believe in Him from God‚Äôs wrath. When I believe in Him, He gives me His righteousness and I am accepted by God.
		
	</p><p>Lot‚Äôs wife was disobedient and looked back. She died. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to be obedient to you, to the Word, and to find life in You! You led Lot and his family out of the dangerous city when You judged it. Help me to follow You and run from sin and ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù places. Thank you that Your Holy Spirit speaks to me when I need to get out of a place that is dangerous. Thank you that in Your mercy and grace You save me from Your wrath by faith in Jesus. Thank you that by faith in Jesus, I am righteous in Your sight.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
