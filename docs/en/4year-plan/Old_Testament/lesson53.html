	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 1: David heard of Saul and Jonathan‚Äôs death and mourned them.</p><p>Ch. 2: David sought God‚Äôs will and God told him to go to Hebron in Judah, where the people there anointed him as king of Judah. He reigned for 7 years there. The armies of Judah and Israel fought but the army of David was stronger.</p><p>Ch. 3: Abner, the commander of Saul‚Äôs army helped, so that all of Israel received David as king. But David‚Äôs army commander, Joab, deviously killed Abner. David mourned Abner.</p><p>Ch. 4. Saul‚Äôs son, who had taken the throne, was killed and Jonathan‚Äôs son, Mephibosheth fell and became crippled. The people who killed Saul‚Äôs son wanted a reward, but David punished them instead.</p><p>Ch. 5: David officially became king of Israel. He captured the city of Jerusalem. He fought against the Philistines.</p><p>Ch. 6: David wanted to bring the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem. But they carried it wrong and God killed the people who wanted to catch the ark when it started to fall. David was scared. Later, they carried the ark the right way, as written in the law and on the way to Jerusalem they offered sacrifices for sin. David and the people celebrated and David danced before God. His first wife (Saul‚Äôs daughter) told him that she didn‚Äôt like his behavior, but David said that he danced before God and not for people.</p><p>Ch. 7: David wanted to build a temple for God but God said that He didn‚Äôt want David to built it. Instead, God promised to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù David‚Äôs house so that there would always be someone from the house of David who could sit on the throne in Israel. David was thankful and worshiped God.</p><p></p><p>see also Ps. 9, 17, 18, 21, 36, 40</p><p>*Note: David wrote many psalms. Some of them include information about when David wrote them. Most of them do not. You may want to read some of the psalms that could be from this period of David‚Äôs life.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>David waited a long time for God to fulfill His promise to make him king. The Bible has many promises and I also am waiting for some of them to be fulfilled. But I am confident that God in His time will fulfill them. For example, I know that Jesus will return to reign forever. I believe that Jesus is the eternal King and I am waiting for His return. Now, He reigns in my heart.
		
	</p><p>God promised David that there will always be someone from his family on the throne. This Word is fulfilled in Jesus. He is the eternal King and He was born from the line of David. David was a great king in Israel and humbly worshiped God. God is a great King and He is worthy of my worship. I don‚Äôt want to worship God so that others would see and think good things about me. I want to simply look to Jesus because He is worthy of praise.
		
	</p><p>David wanted to build the temple. Maybe I want to do something nice for God to show Him that I love HIm. God doesn‚Äôt need anything but He is pleased when I express my love to Him. God showed me that He loved me when He sent Jesus to die on the cross for me. I show Him that I love Him when, through the strength of His Holy Spirit, I daily trust Him and worship Him by doing what He tells me to do in His Word .

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
