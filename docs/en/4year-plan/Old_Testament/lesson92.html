	Application
</h3>
		<p>I know that when God promises, He fulfills His Word. I can read the Bible and know that His Word is true. Jesus helps me to fulfill God‚Äôs Word just as God helped the people to rebuild the temple when He told them too. Sometimes people are against God‚Äôs word but nothing can stop God. God helps me to fulfill His Word. I can praise God not only in church, but everywhere. I can sing to God and thank Him for His love which He shows me in Christ Jesus.
		
	</p><p>
		
	</p><p>In Haggai, God wrote a lot about Zerubbabel, the person who led the people back to the land of Israel from Babylon (Ezra 2:2). He is important because though him, God fulfilled His promise to David and to us to send a Messiah. Zerubbabel is in the genealogy of Jesus (see Matt. 1:12, Lk. 3:27). Although God‚Äôs people were in Babylon for 70 years, God kept the line of David alive and returned them to the land. Why is this important for me? I see that God always fulfills His Word and Him promises to me in the Bible. He is my Savior and King. He keeps me and can use my life, so that more people would know about the salvation and forgiveness that Jesus gives. I have become a part of God‚Äôs family through faith in Jesus. God also promises to shake heaven and earth and all the kingdoms. He will set up His eternal kingdom where Jesus will reign forever (2:6-9, 20-23).
		
	</p><p>Psalm 126 speaks about the people‚Äôs joy in returning to Israel and says, ‚ÄúHe who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.‚Äù (Ps. 126:6). I can share with people that Jesus is Saviour to those who trust Him and that He is Judge to those who do not trust Him. This can be like planting seeds. It is not easy to tell people the truth and sometimes they don‚Äôt like what they hear. But after the seeds of truth are planted, God makes them grow and  there is a ‚Äúharvest‚Äù of souls who know Jesus. Those who planted rejoice. In the same way, God causes His Word to bring life to people‚Äôs hearts when they believe in Jesus. There is a harvest of people gathered to Jesus. This is very joyful! Lord Jesus, use me to share with people that you are Saviour. You said: ‚ÄúThe harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.‚Äù (Matt 9:37). You are coming soon, Lord Jesus, help me to love you with all my heart, soul and strength and to share your love and salvation with people.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

He is important because though him, God fulfilled His promise to David and to us to send a Messiah. Zerubbabel is in the genealogy of Jesus (see Matt. 1:12, Lk. 3:27). Although God‚Äôs people were in Babylon for 70 years, God kept the line of David alive and returned them to the land. Why is this important for me? I see that God always fulfills His Word and Him promises to me in the Bible. He is my Savior and King. He keeps me and can use my life, so that more people would know about the salvation and forgiveness that Jesus gives. I have become a part of God‚Äôs family through faith in Jesus. God also promises to shake heaven and earth and all the kingdoms. He will set up His eternal kingdom where Jesus will reign forever (2:6-9, 20-23).\n  Psalm 126 speaks about the people‚Äôs joy in returning to Israel and says, ‚ÄúHe who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.‚Äù (Ps. 126:6). I can share with people that Jesus is Saviour to those who trust Him and that He is Judge to those who do not trust Him. This can be like planting seeds. It is not easy to tell people the truth and sometimes they don‚Äôt like what they hear. But after the seeds of truth are planted, God makes them grow and  there is a ‚Äúharvest‚Äù of souls who know Jesus. Those who planted rejoice. In the same way, God causes His Word to bring life to people‚Äôs hearts when they believe in Jesus. There is a harvest of people gathered to Jesus. This is very joyful! Lord Jesus, use me to share with people that you are Saviour. You said: ‚ÄúThe harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 __Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.‚Äù (Matt 9:37). You are coming soon, Lord Jesus, help me to love you with all my heart, soul and strength and to share your love and salvation with people.__\n"}</script></div>
