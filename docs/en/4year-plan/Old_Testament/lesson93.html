	Summary
</h3>
		<p>God spoke to Israel through the prophet Zechariah: ‚ÄúReturn to Me‚Ä¶and I will return to you, says the Lord of Hosts‚Äù (v.3). The 70 years of Babylonian captivity had ended and according to God‚Äôs Word, the people returned to the land of Israel! God gave Zechariah 8 visions in the night about the restoration of Israel, showing them mercy and saying that the temple would be rebuilt. (1:13-17). God said that the day would come when He would cleanse His people and remove their sin (3:8-10). Regarding the restoration and rebuilding of the temple, He said, ‚ÄúSo he answered me, ‚ÄúThis is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‚ÄòNot by strength or by might, but by My Spirit,‚Äô says the Lord of Hosts. 7 ‚ÄòWhat are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. And he will bring out the capstone accompanied by shouts of: Grace, grace to it!‚Äô‚Äù (4:6-7).</p><p>God spoke of the Branch, who is the King and Priest (6:12-13). God told His people ‚Äúmake fair decisions. Show faithful love and compassion to one another.‚Äù (7:9). God spoke about the coming of the Messiah King (9:9, 14:9). 12:10 says that Israel will look upon the One they pierced and mourn.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God is the One who renews me. The people of Israel were disobedient and for 70 years were in captivity in Babylon. Then, by God‚Äôs Word they returned to the land and God helped them to rebuild not only the temple but to rebuild their relationship with God and one another in a right way. When I believe in Jesus, He forgives my sin and renews my life. God has a good plan for me when I seek Him and follow Jesus. It‚Äôs good for me to remember that just as the people couldn‚Äôt rebuilt the temple in their own strength but God gave them help from the Holy Spirit to do it, so also I can‚Äôt live God‚Äôs way in my own strength but God gives me His Holy Spirit to live pleasing to Him. Everything is by His grace!
		
	</p><p>In the book of Zechariah, God says a lot about Jesus. We know that some of these verses have already been fulfilled because Jesus already came, lived on earth, died on the cross, rose from the dead and returned to heaven. But we are waiting for His second coming when He will take His own to be with Him, punish and judge the unbelievers and reign as King forever. I believe that Jesus is coming soon! I want to live each day for His glory and tell people about Him so that they won‚Äôt perish but will have eternal life through faith in Jesus. Jesus saves us by His grace.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
