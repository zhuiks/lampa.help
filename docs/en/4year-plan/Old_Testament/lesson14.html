	Application
</h3>
		<p>God answers prayer. Abraham‚Äôs servant wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, but he asked God to help him and He did!  He prayed specifically to God. I can pray to God and he hears me.  He wisely gives me what is best for me at the right time. God knew that Rebecca would be at the well when Abraham‚Äôs servant was there praying.  God also knows all about my life, where I am and where I will be. He leads and guides me in life. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, thank You that you guide me, please help me to follow You! </em>
	</p><p>Rebekah is a good example to me. She was ready to help and work hard to bring lots of water to the thirsty camels! Am I ready to help where there is a need? Jesus, give me a heart of love to see where I can help and give me strength to do it.  Rebecca agreed to be Isaac‚Äôs wife and travel to a far land to be with him. She didn‚Äôt see Isaac, but she heard about him and agreed to be his wife. I don‚Äôt see Jesus now, but I can agree to follow Him. When I learn about Him from the Bible, I love Jesus more and more. Jesus calls believers to live life with Him now and forever. Isaac loved his bride, Rebekah and Jesus loves His Bride, the Church. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, I love you and I‚Äôm waiting for your return!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
