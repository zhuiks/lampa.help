	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Chapt. 1-4: God commanded them to count all the men (20 years and older) from each tribe and to count the Levites because they would serve in the tabernacle and carry it when they journeyed to a new place. God told the people how to set up camp around the tabernacle. God explained how the Levites would serve. Only the sons of Aaron could offer sacrifices for the people. The other Levites helped to serve in the tabernacle. God required the redemption of every firstborn in Israel. God gave instructions for how Aaron‚Äôs sons should pack the tabernacle when they needed to move it. Certain Levites, the  Kohathites were allowed to carry the tabernacle (4:15).</p><p>Chapt. 5-6: God gave instructions for unclean people and the Nazarite vow. God gave the priests (those who helped the people to worship God) a blessing to say to the people: Num. 6:24-26 ‚ÄúThe Lord bless you and keep you; 25 The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; 26 The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.‚Äù‚Äô</p><p>Chapt. 7-8: for 12 days, the priests consecrated the tabernacle so they could start to bring sacrifices to God for the people and worship Him. All the Levites were consecrated for serving in the tabernacle.</p><p>Chapt. 9: The children of Israel celebrated the Passover. When they set up the tabernacle, they saw God‚Äôs presence with them (15-23).  Starting from the time that the Israelites left Egypt (see Ex. 13:20-22, 40:34-38), God led His people everyday. Ex.13:21-22 says, ‚Äú...the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. 22 He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people.‚Äù God‚Äôs pillar moved in order to lead them to the promised land. Sometimes the pillar was in one place for a short time and sometimes for a long time but when the pillar started to move, the people were suppose to gather their things and follow it (Num. 9:15-23).</p><p>Chapt. 10: God gave them instructions for how to know when they needed to move. They made 2 silver trumpets so everyone would hear the signal for when they needed to move. God led the people further (see v 11-13).</p><p></p></section>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
