	Summary
</h3>
		<p>The people of Israel fought against the Philistines. Israel lost the first battle and many people died. In the next battle, they brought the ark of the covenant and thought that it would help them to win. But the Philistines won and took the ark of the covenant. During the battle, the sons of Eli died. When Eli heard the news that the ark was captured, he fell over and died. The words of God about his household were fulfilled. Later, in the Philistine cities, wherever the ark was, people had lots of problems and sickness. God even made the statue of their false god fall over in front of the ark. The Philistines decided to send the ark back to Israel. They put it on a wagon along with gifts on the road leading to Israel.</p><p>The Israelites were glad that the ark returned to them and worshipped God right away. Some people looked into the ark and died. Samuel led the people in sincere worship of God and they put away all their idols. When the Philistines attacked again, God protected them.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>I know that nothing and no one is stronger or more important that God. God should be the most important person in my life. When I trust God (Jesus), He protects me from enemies. Jesus, help me to make you the most important person in my life. Things (money or people) can‚Äôt save me from problems. I need Jesus, who forgives my sin and changes my heart. He is with me in difficulties and guides me.
		
	</p><p>*It‚Äôs interesting to notice that the Philistines knew about God. What did they know? See 1 Sam. 4:8 and 6:6. They knew that God was strong but they didn‚Äôt believe that He is the only God and that they should leave their idols and follow the living God. I want to follow God fully. I want to tell people that it‚Äôs not enough to know that Jesus is the Savior, but that they need to trust Him completely. He alone is worthy of worship.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
