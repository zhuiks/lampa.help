	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Chapter 6: Nearly all the people on earth did not love God and they had evil thoughts all the time (6:8). God saw that Noah loved Him and told him, that He would destroy the earth and that Noah should build an ark (a special boat). Noah was to gather 2 of each kind of animal into the ark. (7 of each kind of the clean animals). God made a covenant with Noah. Noah did all that God commanded him to do.</p><p>Chapter 7: Noah and his family (8 people in all) along with the animals went into the ark. God closed the door of the ark. It rained 40 days and 40 nights and water covered even the tops of the mountains. All the people and animals left on earth died.</p><p>Chapter 8: The ark rested on Mount Ararat. Noah waited until the waters went down and the land dried up. He sent out a raven and later a dove in order to know if they all could go out and live on land again. Then, God said that they could go out.  Noah built an altar and sacrificed to God. God liked the sacrifice. He promised that He would never flood the whole earth again (8:21).</p><p>Chapter 9: God showed Noah and his family a rainbow and said that the rainbow would remind them that God would never again flood the entire earth with water.</p><p></p><p>see also Heb 11:7 ‚ÄúBy faith Noah,‚Ä¶prepared an ark for the saving of his household‚Ä¶and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.‚Äù</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>Noah believed God and trusted Him. Just as Noah followed God, I too can follow Jesus even when others around me don‚Äôt love Him. Jesus helps me to listen to God and do what He tell me to do.  When I see a rainbow, it reminds me of how God saved Noah and his family. I can praise God for how Jesus saves me by His grace when I believe in Him.
		
	</p><p>God made a covenant to save Noah and his family from the flood. He made a covenant with all people to never flood the whole earth again. A covenant is a promise or an agreement. We now live in the time of the New Covenant. That means that Jesus promises to save us by grace when we believe in Him.
		
	</p><p>The story of the flood also reminds us that God will judge the whole earth one day. Those who believe in Jesus will be saved from God‚Äôs wrath and punishment (just like Noah‚Äôs family was saved from the flood).Believers will be with God forever!  Those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus will be punished eternally. Noah was a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5). That means that he was telling people about God before the flood came (with words and deeds). I too can tell people about salvation in Jesus and the judgement to come to warn people. I want people to know that Jesus wants to forgive their sin and cleanse their hearts!

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
