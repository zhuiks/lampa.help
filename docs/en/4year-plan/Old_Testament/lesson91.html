		<p>Ch. 7: Daniel had a dream where there were 4 animals. One had 10 horns and then one horn became greater. Later, Daniel saw the throne of God where He judged and gave all authority to the Son of Man. Daniel didn‚Äôt understand what God showed him and asked to know the meaning. God explained that the animals represented different kingdoms that would rule for a time but that God and His people would reign forever in His kingdom (v. 27).</p><p>Ch. 8: Daniel had a vision of a ram and a goat fighting. Again he saw a horn that ‚Äú‚Ä¶will throw truth to the ground and will be successful in whatever it does‚Äù (v. 12). God sent the angel Gabriel to explain the vision to Daniel. The horn is an evil ruler in the last days, whom God will judge. Daniel felt ill because he didn‚Äôt understand everything and it was all very serious.</p><p>Ch. 9: Daniel prayed to God and asked forgiveness for himself and his people who were in captivity for 70 years. God again sent Gabriel to Daniel and answered his prayer. He told Daniel about the 70 weeks in the last days.</p><p>Ch. 10: God strengthened Daniel, who was weak in the presence of God and His angels.</p><p>Ch. 11: God revealed to Daniel very detailed political information about different kings and the last days.</p><p>Ch. 12: God told Daniel that there would be tribulation in the last days, judgement and the salvation for the people of Israel (v. 1). He also spoke of resurrection: ‚ÄúMany of those who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to eternal life, and some to shame and eternal contempt.‚Äù (v.2).</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God has a good plan for us. He knows everything that happens and guides everyone. He has an eternal plan to save believers and to judge nonbelievers. What do I believe about Jesus? Do I believe that He is King and that He has an eternal kingdom? Do I know that I belong to His kingdom? Only through faith in Jesus Christ can I have forgiveness from God and become His child. Daniel trusted God and sought to give God glory in everything. I also can live for Jesus‚Äô glory because he helps me with the Holy Spirit.
		
	</p><p>The last days will be scary for those who don‚Äôt believe in Jesus. I want to tell people about salvation in Jesus so that He would give them the gift of eternal life. Daniel prayed to God and asked forgiveness for himself and for his people. I also can pray to God and trust in His mercy and righteousness. I don‚Äôt have any righteousness of my own, but I believe that Jesus, the Righteous One paid for my sins and that He gives me strength to live God‚Äôs way.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
