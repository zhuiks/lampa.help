	Summary
</h3>
		<p>God told Joshua that he was old and that there was still much land to be taken. He wrote where each tribe should live. The tribes of Gad and Manasseh settled on the eastern side of the Jordan river. The tribe of Levi didn‚Äôt inherit land, but was scattered in different cities throughout the territory of Israel. God told them that He was their inheritance (13:33). Caleb was one of the spies that Moses sent to scout out the land 40 years earlier. Only he and Joshua trusted God and told the people to enter the land, as God said. At that time,  God had promised that Caleb and Joshua would go into the land and receive their inheritance. Now Caleb was 85 years old but God gave him strength to fight for his land and he lived there. When the tribes fought for the land, they didn‚Äôt completely drive out the Canaanites from their cities.</p><p>Ch. 18-19: Seven of the tribes still hadn‚Äôt fought for their land. Joshua commanded them to fight (18:3). Joshua lived in his inheritance. The tabernacle was in Shiloh.</p><p>Ch. 20-21: A list of the cities of refuge. The list of the cities for the Levites.</p><p>Ch. 22: The tribes on the eastern side of the Jordan river went home after taking the land. Joshua told them to love God and follow Him. They returned and made an altar. Other tribes saw this, didn‚Äôt understand and wanted to fight against them. They thought that the eastern tribes started to worship God their own way, and not according to the law. They asked them why they built the altar. They answered that they simply wanted to remember what God had done in order to teach their children to follow God. They wanted the altar to be a witness. They knew that they were only supposed to bring sacrifices to God‚Äôs altar at the tabernacle (in Shiloh). The other tribes understood and went home in peace.</p><p>Ch. 23-24: Joshua knew that he would die soon and spoke to the people about God‚Äôs faithfulness. He told them to love God (23:11) and warned them that they wouldn‚Äôt continue to live in the land if they didn‚Äôt follow God (23:16). He gathered the people and reminded them of the people‚Äôs history and all that God had done for them. He wanted the people to chose to follow God and said ‚ÄúBut if it doesn‚Äôt please you to worship Yahweh, choose for yourselves today the one you will worship: the gods your fathers worshiped beyond the Euphrates River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my family, we will worship Yahweh‚Äù (24:15). The people made a covenant that they would follow God. Then Joshua died. ‚ÄúIsrael worshiped Yahweh throughout Joshua‚Äôs lifetime and during the lifetimes of the elders who outlived Joshua and who had experienced all the works Yahweh had done for Israel‚Äù (24:31).</p><p>‚ÄúJoseph‚Äôs bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the parcel of land Jacob had purchased‚Ä¶ It was an inheritance for Joseph‚Äôs descendants‚Äù (24:32). See also Heb. 11:25.</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God said that He would give people the land and He kept His Word. He even gave ‚Äúgrandpa‚Äù Caleb strength to fight for his land! God helps me and gives me strength to fulfill His Word and be obedient to Him. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit so I can love God and follow after Him.
		
	</p><p>Through the Bible, God shows me how to follow Him. I read His promises to me in the Bible and believe that He fulfills His Word. For example, the Bible says that in Jesus, sin no longer controls me (Rom. 6:6).  Just as God helped Israel to drive the enemies out of the land, so also Jesus helps me to drive sin and every bad habit and thought out of my heart, so that I can love God. Also, as God gave the people the land, where they could live, Jesus promises to prepare a place for me in heaven, so that I can live with Him forever.
		
	</p><p>Joshua told the people to love God and to follow Him. God warns the people that it will be very hard for them and that they won‚Äôt live in the land if they start to live their own way. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus Christ, help me to love you and follow you. Help me to chose to follow You for my whole life. Jesus, only in You is there full life and joy!</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
