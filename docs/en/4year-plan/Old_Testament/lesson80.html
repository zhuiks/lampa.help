	Summary
</h3>
		<p>2 Kings 18:20: Hezekiah reigned in the southern kingdom (Judah) and trusted God. During his reign, Assyria took the northern kingdom (Israel) into captivity because of their disobedience. Hezekiah also feared the threat of the king of Assyria and prayed to God. God told him through the prophet Isaiah that He would save them from the enemy. God send an angel who killed many soldiers in the enemy‚Äôs army and they left. Hezekiah later got sick and God said that he would die. But when Hezekiah prayed to God, He decided to give him another 15 years to live. When people from Babylon came to visit Hezekiah, he proudly showed them all of his treasures. God told Hezekiah through Isaiah that later, the Babylonians would take all his treasures for themselves. Hezekiah didn‚Äôt take God‚Äôs words seriously. After a few more generations, God sent Babylon to take the southern kingdom away to captivity.</p><p>2 Chron Ch. 29-32: Hezekiah helped people to turn back to God and start worshiping God rightly. 30:20, 26 and 31:20-21.</p><p>‚ÄúThen Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the Lord‚Äôs temple in Jerusalem to observe the Passover of Yahweh, the God of Israel.‚Äù (2 Chron.30:1). ‚ÄúSo the couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the hand of the king and his officials, and according to the king‚Äôs command, saying, ‚ÄúIsraelites, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel so that He may return to those of you who remain, who have escaped from the grasp of the kings of Assyria. 7 Don‚Äôt be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to Yahweh, the God of their ancestors so that He made them an object of horror as you yourselves see. 8 Don‚Äôt become obstinate now like your fathers did. Give your allegiance to Yahweh, and come to His sanctuary that He has consecrated forever. Serve the Lord your God so that He may turn His burning anger away from you, 9 for when you return to Yahweh, your brothers and your sons will receive mercy in the presence of their captors and will return to this land. For Yahweh your God is gracious and merciful; He will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.‚Äù 10 The couriers traveled from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but the inhabitants laughed at them and mocked them. 11 But some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem. 12 Also, the power of God was at work in Judah to unite them  to carry out the command of the king and his officials by the word of the Lord.‚Äù (2 Chron. 30:6-12).</p><p>1 Chron.32:25 because of pride, wrath was upon the southern kingdom. God tested the heart of the king (32:31).</p><p>According to Jer. 26:18, Micah spoke these words against the corrupt leaders during Hezekiah‚Äôs reign: ‚ÄúTherefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the hill of the temple mount will be a thicket. ‚Äú (3:12).</p><p>Isaiah 15-39: God gave Isaiah these worlds when Hezekiah was king. He spoke of the judgement of the nations that didn‚Äôt believe in God. He warned people to not trust Assyria. He said that the great Babylonian empire would one day fall.</p><p>Ch. 24: a description the end of the world and God‚Äôs wrath upon the earth.</p><p>Ch. 25: Those who trust God will live on a new earth</p><p>Ch. 26: There is hope for those who trust in God. (v. 19 speaks of resurrection).</p><p>Ch. 27-29: God punished the disobedient people. God warns them to not trust Egypt, who can‚Äôt save them. (ch. 30-31)</p><p>Only God can help.</p><p>Ch. 32-38: God calls people to trust Him and not their own strength. God blesses those who trust Him and punishes those who don‚Äôt.</p><p>Ch. 36-39: a repetition of the story found in 2 Chron 29-32</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>When I look at the life of Hezekiah, I see that it‚Äôs important to trust God and remember that He is the most important. When Hezekiah was humble before God, everything was ok in his kingdom. Even when enemies came, God miraculously saved them. When I seek God (read his Word, pray to Him and desire His help daily) He blesses me with peace and joy in my heart even if my circumstances aren‚Äôt peaceful around me. I know that He is with me and that He hears my prayers.
		
	</p><p>Hezekiah was proud of his riches and boasted before people. He didn‚Äôt understand that every blessing comes from God. When I am successful, I should remember that success comes from God and I should thank Him. God, help me to always trust You and not trust in my own strength or wisdom. Also, help me to be obedient to Your Word and listen to those who want to warn me if I start to walk away from You. Give me a humble heart. A humble heart is a happy heart. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to be thankful for all that You give  and have a humble heart before You and others always.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.

God tested the heart of the king (32:31).\n  According to Jer. 26:18, Micah spoke these words against the corrupt leaders during Hezekiah‚Äôs reign: ‚ÄúTherefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become ruins, and the hill of the temple mount will be a thicket. ‚Äú (3:12).\n  Isaiah 15-39: God gave Isaiah these worlds when Hezekiah was king. He spoke of the judgement of the nations that didn‚Äôt believe in God. He warned people to not trust Assyria. He said that the great Babylonian empire would one day fall.\n  Ch. 24: a description the end of the world and God‚Äôs wrath upon the earth.\n  Ch. 25: Those who trust God will live on a new earth\n  Ch. 26: There is hope for those who trust in God. (v. 19 speaks of resurrection).\n  Ch. 27-29: God punished the disobedient people. God warns them to not trust Egypt, who can‚Äôt save them. (ch. 30-31)\n  Only God can help.\n  Ch. 32-38: God calls people to trust Him and not their own strength. God blesses those who trust Him and punishes those who don‚Äôt.\n  Ch. 36-39: a repetition of the story found in 2 Chron 29-32\n\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign\n- God is our protection\n- God is our help\n- He is Mighty\n- He hears our prayers\n- He knows all hearts\n- He is Holy\nApplication: |\n  When I look at the life of Hezekiah, I see that it‚Äôs important to trust God and remember that He is the most important. When Hezekiah was humble before God, everything was ok in his kingdom. Even when enemies came, God miraculously saved them. When I seek God (read his Word, pray to Him and desire His help daily) He blesses me with peace and joy in my heart even if my circumstances aren‚Äôt peaceful around me. I know that He is with me and that He hears my prayers.\n  Hezekiah was proud of his riches and boasted before people. He didn‚Äôt understand that every blessing comes from God. When I am successful, I should remember that success comes from God and I should thank Him. God, help me to always trust You and not trust in my own strength or wisdom. Also, help me to be obedient to Your Word and listen to those who want to warn me if I start to walk away from You. Give me a humble heart. A humble heart is a happy heart. __Jesus, help me to be thankful for all that You give  and have a humble heart before You and others always.__\n"}</script></div>
