	Application
</h3>
		<p>God had special rules for his people and the priests when they wanted to draw near to Him. God didn’t receive those that came to Him differently than He instructed. He wanted people to come to Him by faith (Hab. 2:4 “…the righteous one will live by his faith”). Today, we can come to God only through faith in Jesus.  The law and all the sacrifices showed that sin needs to be paid for and that God is holy. Jesus fulfilled the entire law and He is holy. Jesus is my atonement. He paid for my sin, cleanses me, and makes me one with God.
		
	</p><p>Many people in the world think that they can come to God in their own way and that if they do enough good things that God will receive them. But the Bible says that God is holy and we can’t be in His presence because of our sin. That’s why God sent Jesus to live a perfect life for us and shed His blood to cleanse us. He died for me, but He rose again and now through faith in Him, I can receive forgiveness from God. Jesus redeemed me. He was the once and for all sacrifice for me (Heb. 10:10). Thank you Jesus, for your sacrifice and victory. Cleanse me. I am thankful for your love and for all that you have done for me so that I can be  holy through You and be with You forever.
		
	</p><p>Rom 5:10 “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life”
		
	</p><p>*The day of Atonement in (Lev. 16:29-34) is still practiced by the Jewish people today. This holiday is called Yom Kippur.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
