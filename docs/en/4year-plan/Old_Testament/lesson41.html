	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 1-3: The Israelites were in the promised land but they hadn‚Äôt driven out all their enemies as God had commanded them to do. When their enemies started to harm them, the Israelites cried out to God for help and He heard them. He sent judges (redeemers) to free them from the power of the enemy.</p><p>Ch. 4-5: After some time, after certain judges died, the Israelites again stopped following God and their enemies again overpowered them in their land. The people again called out to God for help and He heard them. God wanted Barak to go and fight the enemies. Barak was afraid to go and asked Deborah, the prophetess, to go with him. She trusted God‚Äôs Word when He said that He would give them victory and went with him against the enemy. God gave them victory, but didn‚Äôt give Barak glory for the battle. Deborah and Barak sang a song about the greatness of God.</p><p>Ch. 6-8: Again, after time, the people turned away from worshipping God and their enemies oppressed them. They cried out to God for help and He sent them help. Gideon was working and cleaning his wheat secretly so that the enemy wouldn‚Äôt come and steal his food. An angel of God appeared to him and told him that God was with him and was sending him to tear down the idol they worshiped and save His people from the enemy. Gideon wasn‚Äôt sure and asked God to show him a sign. God confirmed His Word to Gideon. Gideon was afraid but he did what God told him to do. Many people joined Gideon to fight against the enemies. God wanted only a small number of people to fight so that they would know that the victory was from God and not from people. God said that everyone except for 300 people should go home. At night, Gideon and his army came to the enemy. God told them to take trumpets, jars and torches with them. They blew the trumpets loud, broke the jars and held the torches in their hands. God gave them victory over their enemies.</p><p>Ch. 9-12: ‚ÄúThen the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord‚Äù (10:6). Again and again, their enemies oppressed them. Again and again, God helped them then they cried out to Him.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
