	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch.20: The king of Syria (or Aram) planned to fight against Israel (Samaria). A prophet came to king Ahab and said that God would give him victory. He did. In the spring, the Syrian king again came against Israel, thinking that God couldn’t help Israel if they fought in a field. God again sent a prophet to say that God would give them victory, so that Israel would know that He is God. However, King Ahab made a mistake and didn’t kill the king of Syria. God showed Ahab through a prophet that now he would die because he didn’t do what God had wanted. Ahab went home resentful and angry.</p><p>Ch. 21: There was a vineyard near Ahab’s house that belonged to Naboth. Ahab wanted to buy it but Naboth didn’t want to sell it. Ahab was upset and his wife, Jezebel made a plan to take Naboth’s vineyard. She invited evil people to a banquet with Naboth. The evil people said bad things about Naboth and killed him. Then, Ahab took the vineyard. Later, God sent Elijah to Ahab and said that God would judge Ahab’s family and that they would die for their evil deeds and idol worship. But Ahab humbled himself before God. God decided to fulfill His prophecy against Ahab’s family after his death.</p><p>Ch. 22: After 3 years, the kings of Israel and Judah fought against the king of Syria. King Jehoshaphat of Judah wanted to know God’s will. There were different “prophets” who spoke what king Ahab wanted to hear. The king of Judah wanted to hear from God and not from people. The prophet Micaiah, who spoke the truth was there. Ahab didn’t like him because he didn’t like to hear what he said. Micaiah said that Ahab would die in battle that day. Having heard the prophecy, Ahab disguised himself in battle. During the battle, someone shot an arrow without aiming and it happened to hit Ahab so that he died, just as God had said. After than, his son Ahaziah, who worshiped false gods, reigned. What he did was wrong in God’s eyes.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God wanted Ahab to get rid of the enemy when they attacked Israel. I can think of sin as my enemy. Selfishness and  pride, for example are enemies that attack my heart and mind. Do I try to befriend these enemies of my soul or do I ask God to help me to fight against them. Lord God, is there something in my heart that is not pleasing to You and Your Holiness? Jesus help me to “kill” that which is not pleasing to Him. If I don’t fight against sin in my life, in the end, sin will kill me.
		
	</p><p>Ahab was greedy when he wanted Naboth’s vineyard. Is there  greed in my heart? Jesus can forgive me and change me. Jezebel didn’t value Naboth’s life and helped to kill him in order to get what she wanted. Have I ever acted like that by not caring about someone else and hurting them in order to get what I wanted?
		
	</p><p>The prophet Micaiah shared God’s Word with people even though people didn’t like to hear what he said. Am I ready to tell the truth even when others want me to agree with a lie.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus’ help for passing on God’s eternal truth to others.

Результат этого — 2-х годичный план для младшей воскресной школы, который состоит из 50 уроков по Ветхому Завету и 50 уроков по Новому Завету и 4-х годичный план для старшей воскресной школы со 100 уроками по Ветхому Завету и 100 уроками по Новому Завету. Есть отдельные уроки для Рождества и Пасхи чтобы вложиться в 52 недели каждого года. Каждый урок включает Бого-центричную главную истину, золотой стих, черты Божьего характера, которые можно увидеть в этом отрывке, и практическое применение. Молитвы в разделе Применения выделены курсивом и являются возможным примером того, как сердце может отреагировать на Божье Слово. Планы уроков разработаны для помощи учителю лично подготовиться к уроку. Часто в плане урока можно увидеть много идей для применения. Учитель может, помолившись, решить какие из них передать детям. Идеи поделок, текст для диалога на уроке, и метод изложения не включены в планы уроков. Мы верим, что желание Святого Духа — вести и вдохновлять каждого из вас, когда вы молитесь, чтоб Иисус помог вам передать вечные Божьи истины другим.
