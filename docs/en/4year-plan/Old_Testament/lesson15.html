	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Chapt. 25: Isaac prayed that God would give he and Rebekah children. God gave them twins, Jacob and Esau. Even before they were born, God said that the older son, Esau, would serve the younger son, Jacob (Gen. 25:23). One day, Jacob tricked Esau into giving him the birthright (special rights for the 1st born son) for a bowl of soup. Esau chose to have the soup.</p><p>Chapt. 26: God repeated His promises to Isaac (v.2-4). Isaac went to Gerar because of a famine and told the people that Rebekah was his sister because he was afraid that they would kill him. The king of Gerar found out the truth and said that no one should harm them. God blessed Isaac in the land and people envied him (v. 14). God told Isaac that He was with him and not to fear. Isaac worshiped God (v. 23-25) .</p><p>Chapt. 27:  Later, when their father Isaac was old, he wanted to bless Esau (the firstborn) in a special way. Esau left to hunt special food for his father. Rebekah, told Jacob to dress up like Esau and he deceived his father into giving him the special blessing. Esau was very angry with Jacob when he found out what happened.</p><p></p><p>See also: 2 Cor. 7:10 ‚ÄúFor godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death‚Äù</p><p>Heb. 12:16b-17 ‚Äú‚Ä¶profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. 17 For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.‚Äù</p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God has a good plan for me that He will make happen in His time and in His way. His way is best. Jacob didn‚Äôt wait for God‚Äôs timing and God‚Äôs way.  Jacob did things his own way and didn‚Äôt trust God in order to get what God had promised. Jacob deceived his family and hurt them by what he did. I don‚Äôt want to be tricky and try to get something from people. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">God, help me to be honest. God, you see everything that is in my heart. You see everything that I do and hear everything that I say. Help me to do things your way, Jesus, even if it means waiting.</em>
	</p><p>Isaac was afraid of people when he was in Gerar. Sometimes I‚Äôm afraid of people. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to trust You and know that You will help me. Help me to fear (revere and love) You, God.</em>
	</p><p>Esau didn‚Äôt think that his future and his place in the family were more important than the soup that he wanted at the moment. Do I sometimes want something ‚Äúright now!‚Äù and not think about what will happen later? Later, when Jacob received the blessing from their father, Esau was sad and angry that he had been tricked but he wasn‚Äôt sad that he gave his birthright away to Jacob for that bowl of soup. He didn‚Äôt repent (see Heb 12:16b-17). To repent means to agree that I did something wrong and start to go a new direction, God‚Äôs direction. Rom.2:4 says that ‚Äù‚Ä¶the goodness of God leads you to repentance‚Äù When I think about how Jesus died for me, how He rose again, how He wants to forgive me and change my heart, I see His goodness and I want to repent (to turn and go God‚Äôs way). 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, forgive me when I act like Jacob and try to get something in my own way. Forgive me when I act like Esau and don‚Äôt think about what is more important than what I want at the moment. Help me to go your way, Jesus and not my own way. Thank you that You give me Your Holy Spirit to help me.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
