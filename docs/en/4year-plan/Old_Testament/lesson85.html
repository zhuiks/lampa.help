	Summary
</h3>
		<p>2 Kings 24:8-17 and 2 Chron. 36:9-21: After Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin reigned for 3 months when “Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon along with the valuable utensils of the Lord’s temple. (2 Chron 36:10). Jehoiachin surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar and 10,000 people were led away to Babylon (2 Kings 24:10-14).</p><p>King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, king (2 Kings 24:17). “He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet at the Lord’s command” (2 Chron 36:12). The people didn’t want to listen to God’s Word from the prophets and return to God.“But Yahweh, the God of their ancestors sent word against them by the hand of His messengers, sending them time and time again, for He had compassion on His people and on His dwelling place. 16 But they kept ridiculing God’s messengers, despising His words, and scoffing at His prophets, until the Lord’s wrath was so stirred up against His people that there was no remedy” (2 Chron 36: 15-16).</p><p>Zedekiah rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar. When Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem, Zedekiah tried to escape by night, but was caught and taken to Babylon. Then the king of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and the temple and took the people captive to Babylon along with all the treasures for 70 years, according to God’s Word (2 Kings 25:1-21,2 Chron 36:21).</p><p></p><p>Ezekiel 1-10: God spoke to Ezekiel after King Jehoiachin and the first group of people had been exiled to Babylon. He showed the prophet Ezekiel incredible visions which he spoke to the exiles. He saw heavenly creatures, the throne of God, the glory of God and heard God’s voice (ch. 1-2). God called Ezekiel to be a watchman for Israel and to faithfully speak His words of warning to them (3:16-21). Ezekiel was told to act out the siege and destruction of Jerusalem (ch. 4-5). He spoke of God’s judgement against idolatry (ch. 6-7). The Lord showed him that the people were doing bad things in God’s temple and that they would be punished. In a vision, Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord leave the temple in Jerusalem.</p><p></p><p>Jeremiah: These chapters of Jeremiah took place during the reigns of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah.</p><p>Ch. 20-24: Jeremiah warned people of God’s judgement upon them and called them to do justice and  righteousness (v.22:3). In Ch. 23 God speaks of the Righteous Branch who will reign as king. God says, “Is not My word like fire”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“and like a hammer that pulverizes rock?”(23:29). In ch. 24, God compares King Zedekiah to bad figs that need to be thrown out.</p><p>Ch. 27-28: Jeremiah was told by God to wear a yoke and show Zedekiah that Judah was going to be under the control of Babylon. Hananiah, a false prophet, broke the yoke off of Jeremiah and said that Judah would break away from Babylon’s control. Jeremiah said, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord did not send you, but you have led these people to trust in a lie” (28:15). The Lord told him that Hananiah would die and he did.</p><p>Ch. 29, Jeremiah wrote a letter to the exiles who were already in Babylon. God told them to settle there and not to listen to the false prophets. “ For this is what the Lord says: “When 70 years for Babylon are complete, I will attend to you and will confirm My promise concerning you to restore you to this place. 11 For I know the plans I have for you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“plans for your welfare, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. 12 You will call to Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. 14 I will be found by you”—this is the Lord’s declaration—“and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I banished you”—this is the Lord’s declaration. “I will restore you to the place I deported you from.” (29:10-14). God said, “…I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.” (31:3). He promises to make a new covenant with His people, to write His law on their hearts, to forgive their iniquity and remember their sins no more (31:31-34).</p><p>Ch. 32-34: Jeremiah buys a field during the siege of Jerusalem and the Lord explains that it means that the people will return to the land after their time of exile. God says, “Look, I am Yahweh, the God of all flesh. Is anything too difficult for Me?“ (32:27) and “Call to Me and I will answer you and tell you great and incomprehensible things you do not know” (33:3). In Ch. 34, God says that king Zedekiah will die in peace in Babylon.</p><p>*Ch.37-39: King Zedekiah asked Jeremiah to pray for the people. Jeremiah said that Babylon would take Jerusalem. The officials in Jerusalem beat Jeremiah and put him in prison because they didn’t believe him. The king sent for Jeremiah to hear a word from the Lord. Jeremiah told him that Zedekiah would be delivered into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. He asked to not be sent back to where he was being held (ch. 37). Then the king gave some men permission to throw Jeremiah into a cistern, where there was no water. He sank in the mud. Ebed-Melech talked to the king and rescued Jeremiah from the cistern and he remained under guard. King Zedekiah secretly met with Jeremiah. He told the king to surrender to Babylon so that the city wouldn’t be burned and his family wouldn’t be killed (ch. 38). However, when Babylon came against Jerusalem, Zedekiah fled, his family was killed and the city was burned. The Babylonians released Jeremiah from being under guard. God told Ebed-Melech that he would be saved because he trusted Him (39:15-18).</p><p>Ch. 50-52: God speaks judgement against Babylon. “Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Hosts is His name. He will fervently plead their case so that He might bring rest to the earth but turmoil to those who live in Babylon” (50:34).</p><p></p><p>2 Chron 36:22-23 records that after 70 years, King Cyrus of Persia fulfilled God’s Word spoken through Jeremiah and allowed the people to return to their land and rebuild the temple. (see Ezra 1:1-4 )</p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>The people of Judah didn’t want to listen to God’s Word and return to God. That’s why God punished them. But at the same time, God promised to show them mercy when they turned back to Him. Sometimes, I don’t love God and do things that are not pleasing to Him. He disciplines me so that I would know that my path is dangerous. He wants me to walk closely with Him.
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd"> Jesus, help me to love You, believe Your Word, turn to You and live for You. </em>
	</p><p>Ezekiel and Jeremiah loved God and followed Him at a time that was difficult. People didn’t want to hear the truth and were rejecting God. But God was faithful to tell them the truth, warm them and share His promises of mercy with them. Jeremiah was beaten, put in prison and threatened with death. But God had promised to take care of Him and He did. It is painful to be rejected by people but we are accepted by God.  Jesus was rejected by people and suffered unjustly. He understands what it’s like to follow God the Father and be rejected by others. When things are hard, I can trust God that He is merciful towards me. I can ask Jesus for strength and help. He teaches me that His ways are better and gives me joy and peace in relationship with Jesus. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to love, trust and obey You like the prophets did. Remind me of Your amazing promises, that I would rejoice in You, My Redeemer! Thank you for the hope and future that I have in You, Jesus.</em>

(2 Chron 36:10). Jehoiachin surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar and 10,000 people were led away to Babylon (2 Kings 24:10-14).\n  King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made Jehoiachin’s uncle, Zedekiah, king (2 Kings 24:17). “He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet at the Lord’s command” (2 Chron 36:12).
