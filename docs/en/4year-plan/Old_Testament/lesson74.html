	Summary
</h3>
		<p>Ch. 5:Naaman was a famous successful soldier in the land of Israel‚Äôs enemies but he had a terrible skin disease. Once, he took captive a girl from Israel and she served  his wife. The girl shared about a prophet in Israel who could help Naaman. The king of Syria wrote a letter to the king of Israel about Naaman but the king of Israel didn‚Äôt know how to help him and was upset. The prophet Elisha heard about it and said that Naaman could come to him. Naaman came to Elisha on his chariot with lots of people and expensive gifts but the prophet didn‚Äôt even come out of his house to meet him and told him to wash 7 times in the Jordan river.</p><p>Naaman was upset and had expected different help. He didn‚Äôt want to do what Elisha said but his servant said, that really what the prophet told him to do wasn‚Äôt hard. The prophet told him to wash and that then he would be clean and healthy. Naaman washed 7 times and on the 7th time, according to the Word of God, he became clean! He wanted to give Elisha a lot of presents but Elisha wouldn‚Äôt take anything from him. Naaman said that now he would only worship God. After this he started on his way home but Elisha‚Äôs servant Gehazi caught up to Naaman and lied to him so that he could get some presents from him. He got the gifts and hid them but God showed Elisha what Gehazi had done and put on him the skin disease that had been on Naaman.</p><p>Ch. 6: God made an axe head float, to help the man retrieve it from the river. God told Elisha the enemy‚Äôs position so as to warn the king of Israel. The enemy came to get Elisha and surrounded his city and his servant was afraid. ‚ÄúElisha said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be afraid, for those who are with us outnumber those who are with them.‚Äù 17 Then Elisha prayed, ‚ÄúLord, please open his eyes and let him see.‚Äù So the Lord opened the servant‚Äôs eyes. He looked and saw that the mountain was covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha‚Äù (17-18). God made the enemy blind and Elisha led them to Israel‚Äôs king. The king fed them and sent them away. Later, there was a famine in the land and the king was angry with God and wanted to kill Elisha.</p><p>Ch. 7: God promised to help the people the next day but one man didn‚Äôt believe. Elisha said that this man wouldn‚Äôt take part in the blessing. God used 4 lepers to find the enemy‚Äôs camp, where God had already driven them away. The lepers told their city about the treasures and God blessed the city, but the man who didn‚Äôt believe was trampled by the crowd at the gate. As God said, he didn‚Äôt partake of the blessing.</p><p></p><p></p></section>

	Application
</h3>
		<p>God showed grace and mercy to Naaman. He freely healed him. Elisha didn‚Äôt take gifts from Naaman so that he would understand this about God. Jesus freely saves me by His grace. I can‚Äôt do anything to deserve or earn His kindness. I can follow Elisha‚Äôs example and help people without expecting anything in return. I can follow the little girl‚Äôs example and tell people about the greatness of my God. I can also follow Naaman‚Äôs example and come to God for healing from sickness and for cleansing from sin.  But I better not follow Gehazi‚Äôs example, being sneaky and greedy. This is sin. God sees everything and I can never trick Him. When I sin, I can ask forgiveness from Jesus and ask Him to help me to be honest, loving and giving.

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others. May God give you joy in preparing and in teaching!\n\nscripture = Scripture\nverse = Memory Verse\nmain-truth = Main Truth\nsummary = Summary\ncharacter = God's character\napplication = Application\nsongs = Song Suggestions\n"}</script>
