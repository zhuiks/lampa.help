	Application
</h3>
		<p>David is an example of a person who followed God. He trusted God and loved HIm. There were moments in David‚Äôs life when he didn‚Äôt trust God and sinned. There were consequences for his sin and he repented before God. I want to follow Jesus. When I don‚Äôt love God and sin, I desire to turn to Jesus right away for forgiveness and help to do what is right. God showed David mercy and fulfilled His promises to him in that his son reigned after him and there was always someone from his house who could sit on the throne. I know that Jesus was born from the line of David and that God fulfilled His promise to David through Jesus.
		
	</p><p>God said that David was a man after his own heart (Acts 13:22). I want to be a person after God‚Äôs own heart. 
		<em class="prayer svelte-14gf3qd">Jesus, help me to trust You in everything, today and till the end. Thank you, that You are faithful to help me, lead me and strengthen me. Fill my heart with thankfulness to You that You are My Faithful God and Savior.</em>

The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God‚Äôs character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God‚Äôs Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here. We believe that the Holy Spirit desires to lead and inspire each of you as you seek Jesus‚Äô help for passing on God‚Äôs eternal truth to others.
