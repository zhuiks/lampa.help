The result is a 2 year program for younger children, offering 50 Old Testament lessons and 50 New Testament lessons and a 4 year program for older children with 100 Old Testament lessons and 100 New Testament lessons. There are separate lessons for Easter and Christmas to round out the 52 week calendar year. Each lesson includes a God-centered main truth, a memory verse, a list of God’s character revealed in the passage and an application. Prayers in the application section are italicised and are purely suggestions for how the heart may respond to God’s Word. The lesson plans are designed to help the teacher to prepare personally for the lesson. Often there are many ideas for application offered in the lesson plan. The teacher can prayfully decide which ones to present to the children. Craft ideas, scripts for dialogue with the class and teaching method are not included here.

John would prepare the way for people to receive Jesus. Zecharias didn’t believe right away and the angel told him that he wouldn’t be able to speak until God’s Word to him was fulfilled (Luke 1:20). God said that John would be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb (Luke 1:15).\n  An angel told Mary that God chose her to give birth to the Son of God, Jesus.

I can trust God and His Word. Jesus came into Mary’s womb by the Holy Spirit and that’s why I know that Jesus is sinless. He is God and man. For God nothing is impossible. Does something seem impossible in my life? I am confident that for Jesus it isn’t hard. It is good to follow the example of Mary and believe God’s Word. __Jesus, I praise you and and thank you that you saved me and forgave my sin. Thank you for doing the impossible!

When the time came, God sent an angel to speak to Mary, to tell her that she would be given a baby from the Holy Spirit and that the baby would be Jesus, the Saviour that everyone had been waiting for. Mary believed and praised God. God told Joseph in a dream that Mary’s baby was from God. He believed God. When the time came for the baby to be born, Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem because the king (Caesar) wanted to count everyone in their hometowns. Nearby, shepherds were taking care of their sheep. Angels appeared to them to tell them about Jesus’ birth. They went to Jesus and worshipped Him. They told people the good news. Later, wise men came from the east to worship Jesus. They followed a star that showed them that a King had been born. The star led them to Jesus and they gave Him expensive gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh and worshipped Him.\nCharacter: \n  - Jesus is God \n  - Jesus is Good News(the Gospel)! \n  - Jesus is Saviour\n  - Jesus fulfills prophecy (God’s Word)\n  - Jesus is worthy of worship\n  - Jesus is sinless\n  - Jesus is human\n  - Jesus is God with us\n\nApplication: |-\n  God sent Jesus to save me. He told the good news of Jesus’s birth to shepherds who were maybe poor and to wise men who were maybe rich. God made known the good news that Jesus is King and Saviour to the people nearby and to the people far away. Jesus is Saviour for all people. All people have sinned against God and need Jesus to forgive their sins and bring them into God’s family of love. God told us in His Word that He would send the Saviour and He did! God always does what He says He will do. I can trust the Bible and know that it is the truth. Jesus is God with us. He came down from heaven and became a person like me, only He is also God, so He never sinned. When I look to Him for help and trust Him, He answers and helps me. He is always with me. I want to tell people the Good News: that Jesus is Saviour, that He loves them, that He can forgive them and that He wants to be with them always. Jesus, I worship you!\n"}</script>

He created Eve to be a helper to Adam. He gave him a garden and all the trees, but forbid him to eat from one tree (the tree of the knowledge of good and evil). Satan, in the form of a snake*, deceived Eve and she ate the fruit from the forbidden tree and gave some to Adam to eat. Right away, they knew they were guilty and hid from God. They covered themselves with leaves (as clothing) but God covered their guilt with the skin of an animal.  God made them leave the garden but promised to send a Saviour through a child of a woman (Gen. 3:15).\n  *see Rev. 12:9\n\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- He punishes sin\n- God is Saviour\n- Only God can cover and take away our sin\nApplication: |+\n  God made me in His image! What does this mean? It means that because God is the Creator, I like to create, because God is Spirit, I am spiritual, because God is the Communicator, I communicate, because God has a Reason and Feelings, I think and feel, because God is Relational, I have relationships.*\n  God is so good and gave me life. It’s right that I would love Him most of all, worship Him and follow all that He says, obeying Him. Eve listened to the serpent’s lie and she didn’t trust God’s words. I should not listen to the lie, if someone says that God’s Word is not true or right.\n  Adam and Eve sinned. What does this mean? Sin is when we love something or someone else more than God. Sin is a heart condition. In my own strength, I can’t love God most of all. I need help.God helped Adam and Eve when He covered them with the skin of an animal to show them that sin leads to death and that sin must be paid for with a Life. He promised them a Saviour and God fulfilled His promise by sending Jesus to save us. Because of Adam and Eve’s sin, all people became sinful from birth. But through faith in Jesus, I can be born again from above and Jesus gives me His righteousness. Rom. 5:19 says, “For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.”  I need a Saviour, I need Jesus.  I need to ask God to forgive my sins. Jesus never sinned and so He could take the punishment for my sin upon Himself. He rose to life and so He conquered sin and death.I thank God for the death and resurrection of Jesus.\n  *http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/deeper-walk/features/23549-qmade-in-the-image-of-godq\n\nSongs:\n- God is always with me\n- The name of the Lord is a strong tower\n"}</script>

That’s why Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem (and fulfilled ancient prophecy that the Saviour would be born there). Mary gave birth to Jesus there.\n  Nearby, there were shepherds watching their sheep and suddenly angels appeared in heaven and told them about the birth of the Saviour, Jesus. They found Jesus and worshipped Him. Later, Joseph and Mary brought the baby Jesus to the temple. There, Simeon saw Jesus and spoke about how Jesus is the Saviour. The Holy Spirit had told Simeon that he wouldn’t die until he saw the Saviour. The prophetess Anna also saw Jesus in the temple and told people that Jesus would redeem Israel (Luke 2:38).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- Jesus is worthy of praise\n- God fulfills His Word\n- Jesus is the Gospel, the Good News\nApplication: |\n  Over and over again in this section of scripture it is written that Jesus is Saviour.

He loved them and washed their feet. one of them (Judas Iscariot) betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill him. Jesus explained to the disciples that He would die for them soon and gave them bread that symbolized His body and wine that symbolized His blood. He also told Peter that he would deny Jesus 3 times. Peter didn’t believe it.\n\n  At night, Jesus and His friends prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. But the disciples fell asleep. Jesus prayed to the Father and said, “let it be: not how I want it to be, but how You want it to be: (Matt. 26:39)\n\n  Judas Iscariot came with people and they took Jesus. They led Him to judgement before the religious leaders and to the Roman governor, Pilate. They wanted to kill Him, because He said that He is the Son of God, but they didn’t believe that He is the Son of God. Pilate knew that Jesus was innocent, but was afraid of the opinion of people and gave the order to crucify Jesus. At the time of the judgement, Peter denied Jesus 3 times, just like Jesus said. Peter cried. The soldiers treated Jesus very rudely; they hit Him and laughed at Him.\n\n  Jesus hung on the cross between 2 criminals. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised him that he would be with Him in paradise that day. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the curtain in the temple tore from top to bottom. Jesus said “It is finished!” (Jn.19:30) He died.\n\n  The disciples saw that Jesus was buried in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it. On the third day, just as He said, Jesus rose again! The women came to anoint His body, but they saw angels that told them that He rose. A couple of disciples ran to the tomb and saw that He wasn’t there but they didn’t understand that He was alive. Some of the disciples saw the Risen Jesus right near the tomb.\n\n  Later, Jesus appeared to the other disciples in a new glorified body. He brought Peter back into close friendship with him after he had denied Him. He ate with His friends, spoke with them and gave them the Holy Spirit. He forgives the sins of all who trust Him. Jesus said, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day, 47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” Luke 24:46-47.\nCharacter: \n  - Jesus is God\n  - Jesus is Saviour\n  - Jesus is the Victor\n  - Jesus is Redeemer\n  - Jesus is alive!\n\n\nApplication: |-\n  I know that Jesus died for my sins and rose again. Only He lived a sinless life and only He can forgive my sin and cleanse me. I trust His righteousness and know that only through faith in Him, I am saved. I am not saved by good works or good behavior. Jesus saved me by His grace. Jesus is alive! I want to tell everyone about my salvation in Jesus!

God saw that Noah loved Him and told him, that He would destroy the earth and that Noah should build an ark (a special boat). Noah was to gather 2 of each kind of animal into the ark. (7 of each kind of the clean animals). God made a covenant with Noah. Noah did all that God commanded him to do.\n  Gen. 7: Noah and his family (8 people in all) along with the animals went into the ark. God closed the door of the ark. It rained 40 days and 40 nights and water covered even the tops of the mountains. All the people and animals left on earth died.\n  Gen. 8: The ark rested on Mount Ararat. Noah waited until the waters went down and the land dried up. He sent out a raven and later a dove in order to know if they all could go out and live on land again. Then, God said that they could go out.  Noah built an altar and sacrificed to God. God liked the sacrifice. He promised that He would never flood the whole earth again (Gen. 8:21).\n  Gen. 9: God showed Noah and his family a rainbow and said that the rainbow would remind them that God would never again flood the entire earth with water.\n  see also Heb 11:7 “By faith Noah…prepared an ark for the saving of his household…and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.”\n  see also 2 Pet. 2:5, Noah was a preacher of righteousness\nCharacter:\n- God is powerful\n- God punishes evil\n- He is Saviour\n- He is holy\n- He is always good\n- God promises good to those who love Him\n- God makes covenants\nApplication: |\n  Noah believed God and trusted Him. Just as Noah followed God, I too can follow Jesus even when others around me don’t love Him. Jesus helps me to listen to God and do what He tells me to do. When I see a rainbow, it reminds me of how God saved Noah and his family. I can praise God for how Jesus saves me by His grace when I believe in Him.\n  God made a covenant to save Noah and his family from the flood. He made a covenant with all people to never flood the whole earth again. A covenant is a promise or an agreement. We now live in the time of the New Covenant. That means that Jesus promises to save us by grace when we believe in Him.\n  The story of the flood also reminds us that God will judge the whole earth one day. Those who believe in Jesus will be saved from God’s wrath and punishment (just like Noah’s family was saved from the flood). Believers will be with God forever!  Those who don’t believe in Jesus will be punished eternally. Noah was a preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5). That means that he was telling people about God before the flood came (with words and deeds). I too can tell people about salvation in Jesus and the judgement to come to warn people. I want people to know that Jesus wants to forgive their sin and cleanse their hearts!\nSongs:\n- My Bible and me\n- The Wise Man Built His House on the Rock\n"}</script>

They followed the star and came to King Herod in order to find out in which city the Messiah was supposed to be born. The religious leaders read the words of prophecy, where it is written that He was born in Bethlehem. They found Jesus there, worshipped Him and gave him treasures (gold, frankincense and myrrh).\n  God warned the wise men to go home by another way. God also sent an angel to Joseph in a dream to tell him to get away to Egypt because Herod wanted to kill Jesus. They left in the night for Egypt. Herod gave an order to kill all the baby boys under 2 years old in Bethlehem because he didn’t want Jesus to be king.\n  After Herod’s death, Joseph, Mary and Jesus returned and lived in Nazareth.\nCharacter:\n- God fulfills His Word\n- God leads us\n- Jesus is King\n- He is worthy of worship\n- Jesus is God and Savior of all the nations\nApplication: |\n  The wise men wanted to worship Jesus.

I also can give Jesus all that is dear to me (my love, attention, obedience) because I love Him. I want to worship Jesus and show that He is the most important. The wise men travelled a long time to see Jesus. They searched for Him. I don’t need to look for Jesus (physically). When I read the Bible, I can know Him. Also, I can pray and know that He hears me.

They decided to build a tower all the way up to heaven, so that they could be famous. God came down from heaven and looked at the tower.

Once, Joseph, Mary, their relatives and acquaintances had all started to journey back home. They thought that Jesus was somewhere with their group travelling back and didn’t know that Jesus had stayed in the temple.  Joseph and Mary returned to Jerusalem and searched three days for Jesus. They found Him in the temple where He was talking with the teachers of the law. He listened to them, asked them questions and answered their questions correctly. Mary said that they were worried and had been searching for him for a long time but He said that He should be in the place that is pleasing to His Father (Lk. 2:41). They didn’t understand Him. Jesus returned home and was obedient to His parents. He grew up wise; God and people loved Him.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is the Son of God\n- God is Father\n- Jesus loves God the Father\n- God the Father loves Jesus\n- Jesus is wise\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus and the Father are one\nApplication: |\n  Jesus calls God His Father because Jesus is the Son of God. Just as children are with their parents and do what the parents tell them to do, so Jesus was in the place (the temple) where people gathered to be with God (worship Him) and hear what He told them (study the Word). In my heart, I love God and worship Him wherever I am and not just at a church service. I can read the Bible to know what God is telling me. With His Holy Spirit, Jesus helps me to follow the Word. Also, Jesus was obedient to His parents. He respected them. Jesus helps me to listen to my parents.\n  Jesus called God His Father. This means that Jesus gives us an example of submitting to and listening to God. Jesus Himself is God but He came into the world to save us and was obedient to death, even death on the cross (Phil. 2:5-11). __Jesus, help me to submit to and be obedient to You.__\n"}</script>

He was a rich and successful person. One day, Satan came into God’s presence and God said “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?“ (Job 1:8). God allowed Satan to bother Job.  Job lost his children, possessions and health. He said “…The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; Blessed be the name of the Lord.“ (Job 1:21) Job’s friends came to comfort him. They sat in silence for 7 days. Job said “I know that my Redeemer lives “ (Job 19:25-27) and he trusted that God would save him one day.  The his friends started to lecture him and said that he had sinned and that was why all these terrible things had happened to him. Job said that he hadn’t sinned and justified himself more than God (Job 32:2). In the end, God answered Job and showed him that He is the Great Creator who has authority and wisdom and knowledge. Job repented, that is, he agreed that God was right and turned to God (Job 42:6). God blessed Job and gave him more than he had lost earlier.\nCharacter:\n- God has all authority\n- God is Creator\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is merciful\n- Jesus is the Redeemer\n- Jesus will stand on the earth again\n- God gives eternal life\nApplication: |\n  When I am sick or something bad happens in my life, it doesn’t always mean that I sinned. Some bad things happen because of my disobedience but other bad things happen because we live in a sinful world where there is suffering. God allowed Satan to bother Job in order to demonstrate Job’s love for God. Job didn’t love God just because He had blessed him with riches and success but rather because God is worthy of praise.\n  God is with us when we suffer. Jesus came and suffered for us and understands our difficulties.  I believe in Jesus because He is worthy and not just because He gives me things that I like. God loves me and I love Him too. I worship Him because He is God (wise, holy, great and loving). He gives me good things (a home, clothes, food etc) but even if He doesn’t give me these things, through Jesus, He  gives me treasures that can never be taken away: forgiveness, mercy, grace and hope etc. Also, Jesus is my Redeemer, as Job knew. He came and paid for my sin. One day, I will see Jesus face to face!\n"}</script>

The prophet Isaiah had said long ago that God would send John to prepare the way for people to come to Jesus for salvation. Many people came to John by the Jordan river. John told them that they should repent and start living in the way that pleased God. He also said that Jesus would come soon and would baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire, and not with water. He also said that Jesus would judge people (Lk. 3:17). Jesus came to John to be baptized. The Holy Spirit came down upon Jesus in the form of a dove and God the Father said “You are my Beloved on, I am very pleased with You.” Jesus was about 30 when He began His ministry (Lk. 3:23). He is the Son of God.\nCharacter:\n- God is made up of the Three persons of the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)\n- Jesus fulfills the Word of God\n- God the Father loves God the Son\n- God calls us to repentance\n- God controls history\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- God is Holy\n- Jesus is Judge\nApplication: |+\n  John the Baptist spoke the Word of God to people and called them to repent and told them about forgiveness from God. He told people about Jesus. Repent means to turn away from living my way and turn towards Jesus, so He can help me to live His way. When I repent and  trust Jesus, He saves me and gives me His Holy Spirit. God the Holy Spirit lives in every believer and give them strength to live God’s way. He gives believers God’s love, strength and wisdom. Like John the Baptist, I too can share the truth about Jesus and tell people that they need to repent, trust Jesus and receive forgiveness from Him. I can warn people that Jesus will judge and punish those that don’t repent, believe and follow Him. __Jesus, thank you for forgiveness of my sins and salvation from eternal punishment! __\n  Jesus came to be baptized in order to show that He was committed to (sanctified to) God and His plan of salvation. When He went under the water, it was showing how He was going to take our sin and die for us on the cross. When He came up from the water, it was showing how He would rise from the dead. Jesus is God. God the Father loves the Son.\n  In this passage, I see the Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). They are One. Every characteristic that God the Father has, God the Son and God the Spirit have also. God the Father is loving. God the Son is loving. God the Spirit is loving. God is a God of fellowship. He chose to manifest Himself to us in the Trinity, so that we would understand that He created us for fellowship with Himself and one another.\n\n\n...\n"}</script>

He promised to make a great nation out of Abram and bless all the nations of the earth through him.  Abram was obedient to God. He came to the land of Canaan. There God revealed Himself to Abram and promised to give that land to his descendants. Abram built an altar to the Lord. Later, when there was a famine (no food) in the land, Abram went to Egypt. He was afraid that the Egyptians would kill him and take his wife, Sarai. He asked her to say that she was his sister. People took Sarai to the house of Pharaoh anyway but God protected her and struck the household of Pharaoh because he had taken her. Pharaoh returned Sarai to Abram and asked him to leave.\nCharacter:\n- God is generous\n- God blesses his people\n- God protects His people\n- God is trustworthy\nApplication: |\n  God fulfilled His promise to Abraham and He fulfills His promise to me.

Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” or 2\n  Pet. 2:9 “the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations “\nSummary: |\n  Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert. He was there for 40 days and didn’t eat. Then the devil tempted Jesus and wanted Him to prove that He is God’s Son by turning rocks into bread. Jesus answered with the Word “it is written, man will not love on bread alone but by every word of God.” (Matt. 4:4) Then the devil wanted Jesus to throw Himself down from a high place. Jesus again answered with the Word “it is written, do not put the Lord your God to the test.” (Matt. 4:7) Then the devil showed Jesus all the powers of the earth and offered to give them to Him if He would worship Him. Jesus said “get away from me Satan, because it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God alone and serve Him alone.” (Matt. 4:10) Then the devil left Him and angels ministered to Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is sinless\n- Jesus is always right\n- Jesus is Holy\n- Jesus is Faithful\n- Jesus is Pure\nApplication: |\n  Jesus was tempted and never sinned. He is God. The devil tempted Jesus to 1) use His miraculous power for His own pleasure 2) wrongly apply a promise from the Bible and 3) worship the devil instead of God. Jesus responded to the devil’s temptation with the Word. It’s important for me to know God’s truth in the Bible. When I know God’s truth and ask Jesus for help then I can resist temptation. Jesus will help me to do the right thing. Jesus is my example and my help. 1 Cor. 10:13 “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear __it.”__\n"}</script>

Even though Abram was older, he allowed Lot to choose the place where he wanted to live. Lot chose a beautiful green place in the east. He decided to live near an evil group of people. God promised to bless Abram and give him land and many descendants. Abram worshipped God.  The evil people where Lot lived fought and took Lot and his family captive. Abram heard about this and went out to save him.

I can remember that knowing God is most important. It’s not worth it to chose something that looks nice but in reality is dangerous, like Lot did. Often sin looks nice but later we fall into slavery to it, like Lot became a slave. Jesus thank You that You save me from sin.

Then He told them to draw out the water and give it to the master of the feast to drink. The master of the feast tried it and told the groom that usually people give the good tasting wine first and then the lesser wine later but he gave them the best wine at the end.

Sarah told Abram to take Hagar, her servant as a second wife and to have a son through her. Hagar was pregnant with Ishmael and started to look down on Sarah. They didn’t get along and Hagar ran away. God spoke to her and said that her son would have a wild character. God promised to give her son, Ishmael, many descendants. Hagar returned to Sarah. In time, Sarah gave birth to Isaac. Later, Ishmael laughed at Isaac and God wanted Hagar and Ishmael to live separately from Isaac. It was difficult for them when they left. They cried. God heard them and helped them (Gen. 21:17-18). God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael.\n\nCharacter:\n- God always fulfills His promises\n- You are the God who sees me (Gen\n- 16:3)\n- God is merciful\n- God hears our prayers\n- He cares for people\n- He is compassionate\nApplication: |\n  It is better to trust God than to try to fulfill my plans in my way like Abram and Sarah did. This story shows me how God wants to give me His promises of love and grace by faith and not by my works. Ishmael reminds us of how we can try to do things in our own strength which is not pleasing to God. Isaac reminds us of how we receive God’s promise of grace. Jesus saves me by His grace just like He gave Abraham and Sara their son Isaac according to His promise. (see Gal 4).\n  God promised to bring a great nation from Ishmael. They are the great Arab people and today many of them are Muslim. God saw and heard Hagar and Ishmael when they were having a hard time. He saw and heard Abraham and Sarah when they were waiting for God’s promise to give them Isaac. Jesus sees and hears me when I pray to Him. Prov. 15:29 “The Lord is far from the wicked, but He hears the prayer of the righteous.” When I believe in Jesus, He puts His righteousness on me and then I can be with God and He hears my prayers.

He believed that Jesus was from God. Jesus told him that a person needs to be born from above (or born again) in order to see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus didn’t understand Jesus’ words. Jesus explained that people had already been born physically and had a body and that people still needed to be born spiritually with the help of the Holy Spirit. It was still hard for Nicodemus to understand Jesus.\n\n  Jesus said, “No one has ascended to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.  But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God” (Jn 3:13-21).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is the Light of the World\n- Jesus is Teacher\n- Jesus gives eternal life\n- Jesus is loving\n- Jesus took the punishment for sin upon Himself on the Cross\n- God loves the world\n- God judges unbelievers\nApplication: |\n  Nicodemus came to Jesus with questions. I also can ask God when I don’t understand something. Most often, Jesus answers me through the Bible. The Bible is the truth and within it are the answers to the questions about God, the world, and people.\n  Jesus shared an example from the history of Israel when the people had sinned and God told them to look at a bronze snake hanging on a pole (Num 21:4-9). Those who looked up at the bronze snake on the pole, where their sin was judged, were saved by God. When I look to Jesus in faith, believing that He died on the cross for my sin and took my punishment upon Himself He saves me and  gives me new life. When I believe in Jesus I am not judged by God for my sin He conquered sin and death. He forgives my sin.\n  I know that God loves me because He sent Jesus to die for me. I want to live in the light: honestly and openly before God and not hide from Him. I want to tell people about the love of Jesus, so that they would also look to Jesus and receive salvation through faith in Him. Jesus is the only way of salvation.\n\n  see also:\n  2 Cor. 5:21“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.”\n  Gal. 3:13 “Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”\n"}</script>

He said that they would have a son. Sarah laughed when she heard the news. God gave Abraham and Sarah a son, just as He promised them and they named him Isaac, which means laughter. God told Abraham to bring Isaac to Him as a sacrifice. Abraham trusted God. At the last minute, God gave a ram in place of Isaac and said that Abraham should not sacrifice his son.\nCharacter:\n- God is faithful\n- He fulfills His promises\n- He is merciful\n- He is wise\n- God provides\n- Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world\nApplication: |\n  God always keeps His promises. He made big promises to Abraham and Sarah and He kept them.  I can trust God. I believe that He saves me by His grace when I believe in Jesus. God provided Abraham with the ram for the sacrifice instead of Isaac just as He provided Jesus as the sacrifice for our sin instead of me being punished for my sin. I thank God that He gave us Jesus who died instead of me. I believe that Jesus’ sacrifice paid for my sin. I believe that the righteousness of Jesus is necessary for my salvation.\n  Abraham trusted God with his son, who was precious to him. God wants us to trust Him with all that is important and valuable to us. Hebrews 11:17-19 says that Abraham was ready to sacrifice Isaac because he believed that God would raise him from the dead afterwards. I also believe that it’s good when I give to God whatever He asks me to give to Him. Somehow, He will bring life out of that sacrifice. Jesus died, but He rose again and now because of His death and resurrection, I have life in Him! God has provided eternal life to me, through faith in Jesus.\n"}</script>

This was near the sea and Jesus asked Peter if He could teach from his boat. Afterwards, Jesus asked Peter to row farther from the shore and throw his net into the deep waters. Peter said that they had worked all night to catch fish and hadn’t caught anything. But Peter acted according to Jesus’ Words and threw his net into the deep. When he did, he caught so many fish that his boat started to sink! Peter fell on his knees before Jesus and said “go away from me Lord, for I am a sinner.” Jesus said “don’t fear, from now on you will be a fishers of men.” (Luke 5:8,10)\n  Peter, James and John left everything and followed after Jesus.\n  After this, Jesus spent the night in prayer with God the Father. On the next day, Jesus called the 12 disciples who would fellowship closely with Him and follow Him.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Creator\n- Jesus has authority over all of creation\n- Jesus is relational\n- Jesus is Teacher\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus calls us to follow Him\n- Jesus gives people a calling\nApplication: |\n  Jesus did a miracle when He brought many fish into the fisherman’s net. He told the fishermen that they would be fishers of men. He meant that just as fishermen catch fish and bring them to shore, now Jesus would help them to bring people to God. Now they would tell people about Jesus so that people would come out of the meaninglessness of the world and come to Jesus for Life. I also want to tell people about Jesus, so that they wouldn’t live in the world their own way, but would have life in Jesus. Peter and his friends left everything to follow Jesus. Following Jesus is the most important thing. Jesus calls me to be with Him always and live every day with Him, God’s way. __Jesus, help me to know you better, to love You and to follow you every day. Make me a fisher of men and use me to bring many people into your kingdom! __\n"}</script>

The servant prayed for God’s help in finding Isaac’s wife. He prayed that the young woman who would give him and his camels water would be Isaac’s wife. Rebekah came and gave water to him and his camels. God answered his prayer. The servant met Rebekah and talked to her family about her becoming Isaac’s wife. Rebekah decided to leave her family and marry Isaac.

Many people came and it was so crowded that there wasn’t even room near the door. Four friends brought their paralyzed friend to Jesus but they couldn’t get in the door of the house. They decided to lower their friend down through the roof of the house! Jesus saw their faith and said “son, your sins are forgiven” The spiritual leaders were also there and were offended because only God can forgive sins and they didn’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus read their minds and asked them “what is easier to say: your sins are forgiven, or stand, take up your bed and walk! but that you would know that I have authority to forgive sins…He said to the paralyzed man “stand, take up your bed and walk!” The man stood and walked and all the people were amazed and praised God saying:”we have never seen anything like this before!”\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus does miracles\n- Jesus forgives sins\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus is merciful\nApplication: |\n  Many people wanted to hear Jesus. Do I want to hear what Jesus says to me in the Bible? Jesus, help me to know you better. The four friends knew that Jesus could help their sick friend and brought him to Jesus. I also can bring my friends to Jesus, so they would know that He forgives sins and heals their wounds, pain and sadness. He wants to help the sick. The paralyzed man needed help, but really we all need help from Jesus. We all have sinned and need Him to forgive our sin. He wants to help me because He is loving and merciful.\n  Jesus read the thoughts of the people that were with Him. He knows my thoughts and I can’t hide anything from Him. Jesus, help me to open my heart to you, so you would teach me to love You and believe in You. Jesus forgive my sin. I believe that You are the Son of God and can do anything.\n  Jesus asked “what is easier…?” Maybe it’s easy to say that someone’s sins are forgiven because no one sees an immediate change. But when Jesus said “stand up and walk” it proved to people that He is God. Because He has authority, the man was healed and stood up. Jesus has authority to forgive sins and to heal sickness.\n"}</script>

Even before they were born, God said that Jacob would be stronger or have a more important place than Esau (Gen. 25:23). One day, Jacob tricked Esau into giving him the birthright (special rights for the 1st born son) for a bowl of soup. Esau chose to have the soup.  Later, when their father Isaac was old, he wanted to bless Esau (the firstborn) in a special way. Esau left to hunt special food for his father. Their mother, Rebekah, told Jacob to dress up like Esau and he deceived his father into giving him the special blessing. Esau was very angry with Jacob when he found out what happened.\n  See also: 2 Cor. 7:10 “For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death”\n  Heb. 12:16b-17 “…profane person like Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright. For you know that afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.”\nCharacter:\n- God has a good plan\n- He is wise\n- He knows everything and sees everything\nApplication: |\n  God has a good plan for me that He will make happen in His time and in His way. His way is best. Jacob didn’t wait for God’s timing and God’s way.  Jacob did things his own way and didn’t trust God in order to get what God had promised. Jacob deceived his family and hurt them by what he did. I don’t want to be deceitful and try to get something from people. __God, help me to be honest. God, you see everything that is in my heart. You see everything that I do and hear everything that I say. Help me to do things your way, Jesus, even if it means waiting.__\n  Esau didn’t think that his future and his place in the family were more important than the soup that he wanted at the moment. Do I sometimes want something “right now!” and not think about what will happen later? Later, when Jacob received the blessing from their father, Esau was sad and mad that he had been tricked but he wasn’t sad that he gave his birthright away to Jacob for that bowl of soup. He didn’t repent (see Heb 12:16b-17). To repent means to agree that I did something wrong and start to go a new direction: God’s direction. Rom.2:4 says that ”…the goodness of God leads you to repentance” When I think about how Jesus died for me, how He rose again, how He wants to forgive me and change my heart, I see His goodness and I want to repent (to start to go God’s way). __Jesus, forgive me when I act like Jacob and try to get something in my own way. Forgive me when I act like Esau and don’t think about what is more important than what I want at the moment. Help me to go your way, Jesus and not my own way. Thank you that you give me your Holy Spirit to help me.__\n"}</script>

The Pharisees saw them and scolded them, calling what they did “work” and “labor” and saying that they weren’t suppose to do that on the sabbath. Jesus answered by reminding them of the time when David came to the tabernacle and ate bread that usually only the priests are allowed to eat. The priest allowed David to eat that bread. Jesus said “But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”” (Matt 12:7-8). Jesus also explained that the priests work on the Sabbath when they serve in the temple, but their service is pleasing to God. Jesus said, “the sabbath is made for man and not the man for the sabbath….” (Mark 2:27-28).\n  A week later, on the next Sabbath, Jesus was in the synagogue (the place where people gathered to read God’s Word and a man with a withered hand was there. The Pharisees wanted to see if Jesus would heal the man on the Sabbath. Jesus knew their thoughts. He asked “what is right to do on the Sabbath? good or evil? to save a soul or destroy it? but they were silent.” (Lk. 6:9).  Jesus healed the man’s hand but the Pharisees were angry.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Healer\n- Jesus is kind\n- Jesus has compassion\n- He is merciful\n- Jesus gives Rest\n- He saves by grace\nApplication: |\n  Jesus always does good. The day, time or circumstances don’t limit Him. Jesus always loves me and helps me. In the law, there was one day when people weren’t suppose to work. This special day is a picture for me to understand that God gives me rest. I can’t work for my salvation or try to gain more of God’s love through what I do. No! My salvation is a gift of grace from Jesus. Jesus and only Jesus is perfect and never sinned. He died and rose again and now invites me to live in His rest every day and not only on the Sabbath. Hebrews 4:9-10 says, “…..”__There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works as God did from His.” __\n  The Pharisees believed that their rules and traditions were more important than God’s love. They didn’t receive God’s grace (undeserved kindness and help). They thought that they needed to be good for God to accept them. But no one is good enough for the Holy God to accept them. That’s why Jesus came from heaven to earth! He is good and always does good. I trust in His goodness and righteousness. He gives me His Holy Spirit to live God’s way. He changes my heart. Do I sometimes think that I can keep the rules by myself and that I’m good? __Jesus, help me to not be fooled. Only You change my heart and help me to love you and others in all I think, say and do. I rest in You Jesus because you did all the work of the law for me. You are the Lord of the Sabbath, the Lord of my Rest.__\n"}</script>

What can man do\n  to me?“'\nSummary: |\n  In Gen. 28:10-22 through Gen. 30:24, Jacob leaves his family because he is afraid that his brother will hurt him. He goes to his mom’s relatives who live far away. On the way there, God speaks to Jacob, showing him a ladder going from heaven to earth and promises to give Jacob the land that He promised to Abraham and to be with Jacob. Jacob goes to live with his uncle Laban, who tricks Jacob into marrying his older daughter instead of the younger daughter that he promised him. Jacob marries the younger daughter too. He takes 2 more wives. God gives Jacob many children.\n  Gen 31-33: Jacob and his family leave Laban without saying goodbye. Laban was angry and ran after Jacob but God protected Jacob. Jacob was going back to the land where his parents were and was afraid to see his brother, Esau. At night, an angel wrestled with Jacob.  God gave him a new name and touched his hip so that it would be weak. Jacob and Esau met and they hugged each other. Jacob and his family found a place to live and Jacob built an altar to worship God.\n  See also: Hosea 12:3-4 “He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and in his strength he struggled with God.Yes, he struggled with the Angel and prevailed; he wept, and sought favor from Him. He found Him in Bethel, and there He spoke to us.”\nCharacter:\n- God is with us\n- God is faithful\n- God keeps his Word\n- God is my protector and my help\n- God is stronger than I am\n- God has good plans for me\n- Jesus came from heaven to earth to connect us to God (like the ladder in Jacob’s\n  dream)\nApplication: |\n  God is with me. God fulfills His promises to me. What promises are in the Bible? In Jesus, He promises to love me, forgive my sin, bring me to heaven to live with him, give me the Holy Spirit for wisdom, help, strength and comfort. I trust Jesus. When I am afraid, I can ask Jesus for help and He helps me just like He helped Jacob when he was afraid of meeting his brother.\n  Jacob wrestled with God and He gave him a new name and touched his hip so that Jacob would never forget that God is stronger. God didn’t want Jacob to try to do things in his own strength.  Jacob started to trust God.  I can ask God for help. I don’t want to try to do things in my own strength. I don’t have enough strength; God always has enough strength!\n  God wants a husband to have only one wife (Gen 2:24). Jacob had many wives and because of that there was jealousy and envy in the family. This was not pleasing to God. God gave Jacob many children. This was part of the fulfillment of God’s promise to Abraham (Gen. 22:17-18) and Isaac (Gen. 26:4).\n"}</script>

At that time, the people living in Samaria and the Jews didn’t get along and didn’t talk with one another (Jn.4:9). The disciples went to buy something to eat. Jesus saw that a Samaritan woman came to draw water asked her to give him some water. She was surprised that he spoke to her. Jesus explained that, “… “Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life.” (Jn. 4:12-14) When Jesus told the woman things that He knew about her life, she understood that Jesus spoke God’s Words and she wanted to find out about how to correctly worship God. Jesus said “You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.” (Jn. 4:22-23) The woman knew that the Messiah would tell them what they needed to know. He said, “I who speak to you am He.” She was glad and ran to the city to tell everyone about Jesus. Many people came to meet Jesus. He was with them for two days and in the end, the people said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of what you said, for we ourselves have heard Him and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.” (Jn. 4:42)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Messiah (the Christ, the Anointed One)\n- Jesus is the Saviour of the world\n- Jesus is Life\n- Jesus knows everything\n- God is Spirit\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus gives us the Holy Spirit\n- Jesus satisfies our thirst (need)\n- God the Father is seeking those who worship Him in spirit and in truth\nApplication: |\n  Jesus came to a place where people from His area and that place usually didn’t befriend each other. He went there because He is Saviour of the world; He loves all people and wants all people to be saved through faith in Him.  I also can go to places where perhaps people don’t want to be friends with me in order to tell them about the love of Jesus. I can tell them that Jesus is the Saviour of the world.\n  Jesus knew everything about the woman at the well. He knew that she needed the life that only Jesus can give people. He knows everything about me. He loves me and wants me to trust him and believe that He is the Messiah and the true Saviour of the world. Do I believe that Jesus is my Saviour? Have I asked Him to forgive my sins and to help me to love Him more than anything or anyone? I can come to Jesus right now to receive salvation just like the people of Samaria came to Jesus in the story.\n  Jesus told the woman that He gives living water, so that she would never thirst again. When I have needs (for love, for wisdom, for help, for peace, for strength), I can ask Jesus and He gives me to “drink”, that is, He takes away the thirst and gives me His Spirit. He is my source of life!\n  Jesus also said to the woman that God wants us to worship Him in spirit and in truth. He helps me to worship Him rightly. He gives me the Holy Spirit and gave me the Bible (the truth) so that I can fellowship with Him and know His heart and His character.\n"}</script>

His brothers envied him and sold him into slavery. He was a good servant in the house of Potiphar. Potiphar’s wife lied about Joseph and said that he sinned but really the opposite was true because he had run away from sinning. Joseph was put in prison and became the head helper there. While he was there, God told him the meaning of the dreams of two of Pharaoh’s servants. Joseph stayed in prison for 2 more years. Later, God gave him the meaning of Pharaoh’s dreams. Pharaoh rewarded Joseph and made him the head of Egypt (after Pharaoh). God blessed Joseph.\nCharacter:\n- God is faithful to fulfill His Word\n- God helps us always\n- God is always with us\n- God gives wisdom\nApplication: |\n  I can trust God when things are hard for me or when people don’t like me. When I am alone, God is with me. Jesus helps me to run away from sinning. God will give me strength to do what is right.

And great was its fall.”\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is the Strong Foundation (the Rock)\n- Jesus is the Word of God\n- Jesus is strong\n- Jesus is Helper\n- He is stronger than problems\n- He strengthens\nApplication: |\n  Jesus was teaching the people about trusting God and loving others (Matt 5-7). That’s why He shared this parable about listening and doing His Word. He wants us to understand what it is like to really believe and live the truth. He explains what happens when we love God and follow His Word. I hear the Word of God at Sunday school. or maybe I read stories in a children’s Bible. When I hear and read, Jesus speaks to me. He not only wants me to hear interesting stories about Him but wants the things that I hear to change my heart. For example, when I hear that Jesus fed the people because He loved and cared for them, I remember that Jesus cares for me and I can ask Him to help me to care for others. If I have cookies, I can share them with someone and show them that I love them and want to care for them. I can tell them that Jesus loves them.\n  In this story, Jesus said that the rain and wind hit hard and destroyed the house that was built upon the sand. Rain and wind can represent problems in life. Sometimes we are sick or we aren’t getting along with someone or we are scared. When we trust Jesus (which is doing what He tell us to do), He is our Rock and Foundation of life. Problems can never be stronger than Jesus! I believe that Jesus is with me, that He is my help, that everything works for good, and that He holds me in His hands. But people who don’t believe in Jesus are like the house built upon the sand. When everything is bad in life, they fall. __Jesus, help me not only to hear Your Word but to trust You and to do the things that I hear from the Bible (to trust You and love others). Thank you that You help me to hear and fulfill Your Word, to Love You and others with my life.__\n  see also:  or 1 Cor. 3:11 “For no other foundation can anyone lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ”\n  James 1:21-22 “…receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.

Joseph sold bread to everyone. Joseph’s brothers came to buy bread. He recognized them but they didn’t recognize him. He put them all in prison for 3 days and after that kept Simeon in prison and wanted them to bring their youngest brother, Benjamin, to Egypt. Joseph put the money for the bread back in his brothers’ bags. When the brothers came again, they ate at Joseph’s house. He hid a cup in Benjamin’s bag and accused him of stealing it. The brothers wanted to help Benjamin. Then Joseph told them that he was their brother. They were afraid that he would punish them but Joseph forgave them. Later, all the brothers brought their father and they moved to Egypt, because there was bread there. Jacob spoke with Pharaoh. Jacob (Israel) blessed all 12 of his sons. When Jacob died, the brothers were afraid again, thinking that Joseph would punish them. But Joseph said that he trusts and respects God. He forgave his brothers.\nCharacter:\n- God is merciful\n- Jesus forgives our sin\n- He provides\n- Jesus reconciles us with Himself and others\nApplication: |\n  I can trust God that He will work everything out for the good. Jesus died to forgive me of my sins. When I trust in Him, He forgives me and with His help, I can forgive others. __God, please forgive me for…God, show me who I need to forgive and help me to forgive them right now.__\n  Joseph tested his brother’s hearts when he put them in prison when he said that Benjamin stole the cup. Maybe he wanted to see if they would help their brother or leave him. How I act when things are hard shows God, me and others what is in my heart. __Jesus, please fill my heart with love and grace. When things are hard, help me to forgive, love and do the right thing.__\n  Note: Depending upon your group, you may want to discuss the ways that Joseph reminds us of Jesus. For example: both were betrayed by their own, both were accused and punished although they were innocent, both forgave their enemies and helped them to live.\n"}</script>

He asked him “Do you want to be made well?” The man answered that he couldn’t get into the pool for healing. Jesus told the man “Stand, take up your bed and walk.” The man was made well, stood, took his bed and walked! The spiritual leaders saw him and scolded him because he was walking around with his bed on the sabbath, but the healed man said that he was just doing what the One who had healed him told him to do. He didn’t know that Jesus had healed him. Jesus later found him and told him not to sin. The man told the spiritual leaders that Jesus had healed him. They got angry that Jesus healed on the sabbath. “But Jesus answered them: My Father has been working until now and I have been working.” (Jn. 5:17).

Jesus always sees me and knows everything that is in my heart. He warns me through my conscience, through the Word and also through other people when I start to sin. He helps me to do what is right when I ask Him to help.\n  Like the Pharisees in the story, there are people who don’t believe that Jesus is God. Jesus Himself said that He is God and did things that only God can do. He never sinned. He rose from the dead and He does miracles which give glory to God. Does Jesus have the first place in my life? He should be most important because He is God. He loves me very much and He is Almighty. He is worthy of my respect and love.  Jesus said in Jn. 5:24 “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgement, but has passed from death into life.”\n"}</script>

So when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, pleading with Him to come and heal his servant.  And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving,  “for he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.” Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.  Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”  When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, “I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!”And those who were sent, returning to the house, found the servant well who had been sick.”\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus has authority\n- Jesus’ words are powerful\n- Jesus is merciful\n- Jesus is Healer\n- He has compassion\n- He is Saviour of the Jews and of all people\nApplication: |\n  The centurion went to Jesus because he knew that Jesus could help. I also can ask Jesus for help. The centurion knew that Jesus had authority and when He said something, it would happen. He knew that Jesus didn’t need to physically be present for his servant to be healed. I don’t see Jesus with my eyes right now but I believe that He hears my prayers, He sees my needs and He is always with me. Jesus was amazed when He heard of the centurion’s faith. Jesus loves it when I trust Him and talk with Him. Our faith is precious (valuable) to Him, more than gold (1 Pet. 1:7).\n  The centurion respected Jesus and knew that he wasn’t worthy for Jesus to come to his house. I understand that I also am not worthy of Jesus’ love, grace and forgiveness. But when I believe in Him, He says that I can come to Him at any time and at any hour with any need. The centurion was Roman and probably didn’t study God’s Word in his childhood like the Jews did. But for Jesus, our nationality isn’t important. He wants everyone to come to Him for salvation, forgiveness and help. He is pleased when we come to Him. __Jesus, I  believe that You are strong, that You are God and that You love me and help me. I love You, Jesus, and thank You for Your love and care towards me.__\n"}</script>

She anointed His feet with expensive oil, washed them with her tears and out of thankfulness, wiped His feet dry with her hair. The host, Simon the Pharisee said that Jesus shouldn’t let this woman even touch Him because she had a bad reputation in the town.\n  “And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” So he said, “Teacher, say it.”  “There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?”  Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more. ”Jesus said that the woman loved Jesus very much because she understood how much God had forgiven her. Simon didn’t greet Jesus well into his home in comparison to this woman. “Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.” (Luke 7:40-47)\n  Jesus told her that her sins were forgiven. The people were amazed that Jesus had authority to forgive sins.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus forgives sins\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\nApplication: |\n  Sometimes I am like Simon, who invites Jesus to be near me but I don’t really respect or love Him much. Jesus, forgive me and give me a heart that understands how much you have forgiven me, so that I would be like the woman who worshipped you out of thankfulness. It’s good to think about the price that Jesus paid for me to forgive my sin. He shed His blood. He gave His life in order to reconcile me to Himself. __Thank you Jesus!

Pharaoh didn’t want to trust God and so the plagues made life painful and difficult for him and his people. When I don’t trust God, there are painful consequences.\n  It is good to trust Jesus. I want Him to be in control of my life. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, describes how Jesus will judge those who do not trust Him and His righteousness.

Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.

All of Pharaoh’s soldiers who were chasing after the Israelites drowned in the sea. After this, the people went into the wilderness and wanted to eat and drink. God did miracles and gave them water to drink and every morning, He gave them “bread” (manna) from heaven. They gathered the manna every morning except for the Sabbath (for them, Saturday) morning. On the Sabbath morning they rested because God gave them a double portion of manna the day before. He also sent them birds (pheasants) to eat when they wanted meat. The Israelites often complained to God and to Moses.\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- He is merciful\n- ' He is wonderful (He does miracles.)'\n- He is faithful\n- God takes care of our needs\n- He is generous and gives us all that we need\n- He is our source for everything and has everything under control\nApplication: |\n  Even when it seems like there is no hope, God is strong to help and save us.

God’s presence was always with the people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.\n  see also Hebrews ch. 9 & 10\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is with us\n- Jesus is God with us\n- The Holy Spirit dwells in the hearts of believers.God gives us a plan\n- God gives us gifts and abilities to fulfill His plan\n- Jesus is the Word who became flesh to dwell (to tabernacle) among  us (Jn 1:14)\nApplication: |\n  God gave the Israelites instructions to build a special place for worshipping Him in the way that He showed them. When I believe in Jesus, He lives in my heart and is always with me. I worship Him with my life and I don’t have to go to a special place to worship. People in the Old Testament drew near to God by faith in His mercy through offering the sacrifices He commanded. All the sacrifices point to Jesus, the perfect sacrifice for sin. I can only draw near to God through faith in Jesus, trusting His sacrifice.\n\n  For discussion with older children: The Tabernacle is a picture  of Jesus, God with us (Jn. 1:14).\n  An open gate: all can come to God through Jesus, the door (Jn.10:7)\n  Walls around the court: so that people come to God only through Jesus, the door (Jn. 14:6 He is the Way)\n  The altar for sin offerings and sacrifices: Jesus is our sacrifice for sin (Heb. 10:12)\n  The washing basin: Jesus cleanses us from sin (Heb. 9:14, 1 Jn. 1:7,9)\n  The lampstand: Jesus is my light (Jn. 8:12)\n  The table for bread: Jesus is the bread of life (Jn. 6:35)\n  The incense altar: Jesus prays for me and intercedes for me (Heb.7:25)\n  The ark of the covenant inside the Holy of Holies: Jesus is the One by whom we draw near to God the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19)\n"}</script>

He who comes to\n  Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.” or 1 Pet.\n  5:7 “casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.”\nSummary: |\n  Jesus was with His disciples when a crowd of people followed Him. They knew that He did miracles and wanted to be with Him.\n  “Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?”  But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He would do.  Philip answered Him, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may have a little.”  One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,  “There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?” (Jn. 6:5-9)\n  Jesus told the disciples to help the people to sit down. He took the bread and the fish, thanked the Heavenly Father and gave out the food to the people. Everyone was filled and there were even 12 baskets of food leftover. Jesus said to His disciples“Gather up the fragments that remain, so that nothing is lost.” (Jn. 6:12). All the people saw the miracle and believed that Jesus was the Prophet of whom Moses had spoken for whom they were waiting. Then they wanted to make Jesus their king, but He left.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus does miracles\n- Jesus is caring\n- He is King\n- He has compassion\n- Jesus is the Provider\nApplication: |\n  Jesus knew the needs of the people and He had a plan to help them. He knows my needs and can help me. For Jesus, nothing is impossible. Jesus took care of people’s physical needs. He also takes cares of people’s spiritual needs. Everyone needs to eat (bread) to live. But everyone also needs friendship with God in order to live. I need to be reconciled to God through faith in Jesus in order to have life. When I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, that He died for my sins and forgives my sin, He gives me new life with God. Jesus took very little bread and fish and fed a lot of people. It’s not important what I have (little or much). It is important that I give what I have into Jesus’ hands so that He would be glorified and do what He wants to with it. People followed after Jesus because they saw His miracles and not because they believed that He was God’s Son. Why do I follow Jesus? Do I want something from Jesus or do I just want to be with Him because I understand that He is the Savior, the King and the Most Important?__ Jesus, help me to love You more. Thank you Jesus that you are caring and loving. Thank you that You died for me and give me life in You when I trust You.__\n"}</script>

When he was there, Aaron and the people decided to make a golden calf and worship it. God told Moses what the people had done. Moses came down the mountain and broke the tablets with the 10 commandments. God wanted to destroy the people for their idol worship but Moses prayed to God and He didn’t destroy them but He punished them. Later, Moses returned to the mountain and again wrote the 10 commandments on the tablets.  God declared His name to Moses (Ex. 34:6) and the people saw that his face shone after talking with God and he wore a veil when he spoke to the people (Ex. 34:29,35).\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God is Spirit\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- Ex\n- 34:6-7, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding\n  in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression\n  and sin, by no means clearing the guilty…”\n- God loves people\n- He is merciful\n- God is good and shows us his truth about what is right and wrong\nApplication: |\n  The people made an idol and worshipped it.

If so, I can ask God for forgiveness and ask Him to change my heart. I need help from God to live the way that God’s wants. Jesus helps me to live for God and love God more than anything else.

It is I; do not be afraid.”\nSummary: |\n  After Jesus fed the crowd of people, He sent His disciples over to the other side of the sea in their boats while He went to the mountain to pray. There was a strong wind on the sea and the disciples couldn’t row to shore. It was around 3am and Jesus came to them walking on the water. They thought that it was a ghost and were scared. Jesus said “it is I, do not be afraid!” “Then He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled.  For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.” (Mark 6:51-52)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus has authority over everything\n- Jesus is Lord of all Creation\n- Jesus knows the hearts of all\nApplication: |\n  Many of the disciples were experienced fishermen and perhaps they thought that it wouldn’t be hard to row across the sea in their own strength. But without Jesus’ help, they couldn’t get to shore. I also can’t do anything without Jesus. Without Jesus everything will be hard and it seems like the wind is blowing against me. The disciples didn’t understand that they needed to give everything into Jesus’ hands (just as they gave the bread and the fish to Him and Jesus multiplied it). I also sometimes think that I can do something without Jesus’ help. This is a mistake. Jesus has authority over everything. He can walk on water. He can stop the wind. Jesus wanted the disciples to understand that they need Him. When Jesus appeared, they were afraid, but He told them to be encouraged (be of good cheer) and to not be afraid. He was with them! Once He was in the boat, the wind stopped.  __Jesus, teach me to turn to you for help and receive strength and wisdom from You. I am encouraged that You have control over everything.

He gave them rules for bringing sacrifices to Him, for what they should eat and how to treat one another.\n  God gave the priests (those who helped the people to worship God) a blessing to say to the people: Num. 6:24-26 ““The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you, and be gracious to you; The Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace.”’\n  Starting from the time that the Israelites left Egypt, God led His people everyday. Ex.13:21-22 “And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people.” God’s pillar moved in order to lead them to the promised land. Sometimes the pillar was in one place for a short time and sometimes for a long time but when the pillar started to move, the people were suppose to gather their things and follow it. (Num. 9:15-23)\nCharacter:\n- God is holy\n- God makes us holy in Jesus\n- God  leads us\n- God has special plans for His special people\n- God blesses us, keeps us and gives us peace\nApplication: |\n  God gave His people special rules to live holy, separate, different and clean. They were suppose to be different from the other people around them. But these laws didn’t change the hearts of the people. Only Jesus can make me clean and holy. Only Jesus can help me to love God and to live pleasing to God. He gives me a new heart to love Him and His ways. He gives me His Holy Spirit so that I can live differently from the world (not selfish) and for God (that I would be like Jesus).\n  God led the Israelites every day. He will show me where to go and what to do when I ask Him to lead me. God leads me day and night and will never leave me. Jesus is always with me and He leads my life. The Bible shows me God’s way. The Holy Spirit helps me  to follow Jesus.\n  Extra explanation about the sacrifices: When the people of Israel sinned (didn’t love God) through their actions and words, God wanted them to bring different sacrifices to the tabernacle. When they did something their own way and not God’s way, they were suppose to bring a sacrifice because the blood covered their sin. Sin (when we don’t love God) leads to death. The blood of the animal sacrifice was in place of the blood of the person who sinned. When they saw the blood of the animal, the remembered that their sin led to death and that they need forgiveness for their sins from God. But the blood of animals can’t make a person’s heart clean. Only Jesus can. He shed His blood for my sin on the cross and now through faith in Him and His perfect sacrifice, He forgives my sins and gives me  a new heart!\n"}</script>

They saw that it was VERY good. God promised to lead them into the land but ten of the spies were afraid and gave the people a bad report. The people refused to follow where God was leading them to go. Only Joshua and Caleb told the people to trust God and to go into the land. God said that now the people had to stay in the desert for 40 years and all the people who didn’t trust God would die before the rest of the people could go into the promised land.

But He seeks me and wants me to be a part of His flock so He can care for me always. How does He seek me? When I hear stories about Jesus, when I hear songs about Jesus, when people talk about Jesus, He calls me to Himself in those and many other ways. Through all those things, He reveals Himself to me so that I would come to Him. When I believe in Jesus, then He receives me into His kingdom where there is joy, peace and love.

He told Balaam to curse them. God spoke to Balaam and from the beginning told him that he could not go to curse the people. Balak asked Balaam to come a second time and promised him a lot of money. During the night, God spoke to Balaam and told him that he could go with them but he could only say what God wanted and not what he wanted. In the morning, Balaam got on his donkey and went to king Balak. The donkey saw an angel with a sword ahead and started to go around him. Balaam didn’t see the angel and got mad at his donkey.

Jesus said that their sin wasn’t the reason that he was blind, but that God wanted to be glorified through his healing. Jesus healed the man and he could see! The Pharisees wanted to know who healed him because it was the sabbath (their day of rest) and they thought that is was wrong to heal on their day of rest. The man said that Jesus healed him and that he believed that Jesus was from God because He did the miracle and helped him. The parents of the healed man were afraid of what the Pharisees thought. The Pharisees wanted to kick out everyone who believed in Jesus but the healed man said that he believed that Jesus was from God and so the Pharisees kicked him out (of the synagogue).

When I believe in Jesus and trust Him, He makes me see Him correctly and I can be a part of God’s family. The healed man was thankful to Jesus and knew that Jesus is Saviour.

He talked about shepherds, their work, responsibilities and how they treat their sheep. A good shepherd will take good care of his sheep and protect them from enemies. Sheep are gathered into the sheep pen to rest. Jesus said that He is the door to the place of rest. Jesus says that He is the Good Shepherd. A shepherd speaks to his sheep and they know his voice and follow him. There are robbers that only want to hurt the sheep (Jn. 10:10).

An angel of the Lord  appeared to a woman and told her that she would have a special child. This child would live according to special rules to show that he would participate in God’s special plan. This child was Samson. He grew up to be very strong because God gave him special strength to fight against the enemies. His strength was from God and God told him to follow special rules and to not cut his hair. A woman named Delilah talked Samson into telling her the secret that if his hair was cut, he would lose his strength. She betrayed him to the Philistines (the enemies) for money. When he slept, they cut his hair and he lost his strength.\n  Samson had killed many enemies but now he was their slave in their prison. His enemies had also blinded him. Later, his hair started to grow and he asked God to give him strength to destroy the temple he was in, where his enemies were worshipping their false god. God answered his prayer.\nCharacter:\n- God sees everything and everyone\n- God is strong\n- God is our help\n- God is holy (He is separate from us, different and pure)\nApplication: |\n  Samson did not always live the way that God wanted and fell into trouble.

He who believes in Me, though\n  he may die, he shall live.”\nSummary: |\n  Jesus heard that His friend Lazarus was sick and died. Jesus purposely didn’t come to Lazarus before he died because his sickness was for the glory of God (Jn. 11:4). Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha. Martha believed in Jesus and knew that He could do anything but she didn’t know if it was God’s will to raise Lazarus from the dead. Jesus told her that He is the Resurrection and the Life.\n  Many people were with Mary and Martha to comfort them. Mary came to Jesus and said that Jesus could have prevented her brother’s death. Jesus saw how the sisters and others were crying about Lazarus’s death. He also cried (Jn. 11:35). Jesus went to the grave where Lazarus lay and asked them to remove the stone. Martha warned that there would be a bad smell because Lazarus had already been dead for 4 days. “Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” (Jn. 11:40). Jesus said in a loud voice “Lazarus, come out!” (Jn. 11:43) and Lazarus come out of the grave! Many people saw this miracle.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is almighty\n- He knows everything\n- He is wise\n- He is the Resurrection and the Life\n- He had authority over death\n- He is loving\n- He is compassionate\n- Jesus is our Hope\nApplication: |\n  Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. He Himself rose from the dead. He also promises to raise me up after death (if I die before His Second Coming). This is why He said to Martha, “I am the resurrection and the life, he who believes in me though he may die, he shall live.” When believers in Jesus die, they have a hope that they will live again with Jesus in His Eternal Kingdom. If I have a friend or a relative who died, knowing Jesus, I will see them again. Jesus will raise up all people. Those who believe in Him will live forever, happy in paradise. Those who don’t believe in Him will be forever tormented in hell. This is why it is important to believe in Jesus! This is why it is important to tell people that Jesus gives eternal life. I don’t want to go to hell and don’t want anyone else to go there either.\n  Also, in this story, I see that Jesus loved His friends and He was sad when they were having a hard time. He sees how the world has sin, sickness and death and how people suffer from this. He came to earth to conquer sin and death. Today, people still die but through faith in Jesus, there is the hope of resurrection and eternal life. I don’t have to fear death because for believers in Jesus, death is just crossing over into God’s presence.\n  Just like the situation with Lazarus, sometimes Jesus decides not to heal someone now and allows them to die. But this doesn’t mean that He doesn’t love the person. Believers will be with Jesus after death and Jesus in His wisdom, knows when to take someone to be with Him in heaven. I can trust Jesus and know that He is wise and has good plans for me and other believers. __Jesus, you are my Hope!__\n"}</script>

Her sons married girls there who were not Israelites.  Naomi’s husband and sons died. Naomi returned to the land of Israel and one of her daughter- in-laws’, Ruth, believed in God and wanted to stay with Naomi, to help her.\n  Ruth went to work in a field gathering grain. She was a hard worker. The owner of the field, Boaz, met her and gave her food. He said that she should work at his field where it was safe. Naomi knew the law about redemption in Israel. According to this law, a close relative could marry Ruth and then take care of her and Naomi. Boaz was a close relative. Naomi told Ruth to go remind Boaz that he was a close relative. Boaz loved God and wanted to help but he waited to see if the other close relative wanted to do fulfill the redemption law and buy Naomi’s land and marry Ruth. But that relative didn’t want to marry Ruth. Then Boaz was happy to marry Ruth and God gave them a child. Naomi thanked God. Thier son became the grandfather of David.\nCharacter:\n- God is wise\n- God is faithful\n- He always is with us\n- God is our help\n- Jesus is Redeemer\n- He paid for our sin, protects us and cares for us\n- God has a good plan\n- Jesus is the Saviour of all peoples\nApplication: |\n  Boaz is a picture (someone who shows us something) of Jesus. Boaz paid a price to redeem Naomi’s land and to marry Ruth. Jesus paid a price when He died for me on the cross to redeem me from my sin and make me His own. He is my saviour who loves me and cares about me. I can come to Jesus for help. I am glad that He never leaves me or forsakes me.\n  Ruth is a picture of the nations (non Israelites) who are a part of the Church. Israel is God’s special people and He showed His plan of salvation through them. He wants all people on earth to know about Him through the Israelites. Ruth, a Gentile (from the nations) came to know God and she was redeemed. Jesus is the Redeemer of people from all nations who trust Him for salvation. Through faith, Ruth became a part of God’s plan. Through faith in Jesus, I too am a part of God’s plan. __Jesus, use my life so that many people will come to know you, that you are Redeemer.__\n  God fulfilled His plan to give Israel the promised Redeemer through the family of Ruth and Boaz. Their great grandson David (about whom we will learn soon) became king and God promised him that the Messiah would come through David’s family. After many years, Jesus fulfilled this promise and came from the family of David. He is our King and Redeemer.\n"}</script>

The person answered correctly: You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself.’ But then he asked “who is my neighbor?” Jesus answered with the following story: Once a man was travelling on the road and thieves robbed him and beat him. He lay there, wounded on the road. Later, a priest walked by and saw him but didn’t stop to help him. The next person was a Levi. He also passed by and didn’t help the wounded man lying on the road. The third person was a Samaritan. He helped him and paid for his treatment to get better.\n  Jesus then asked, which of the three people was a neighbor to the wounded man. The answer was, the one who showed him mercy. Jesus said, go and do the same.\nCharacter:\n- God has answers\n- Jesus sees the heart\n- Jesus is loving\n- Jesus is worthy to be loved\n- Jesus is teacher\n- He instructs\n- Jesus is Wise\nApplication: |\n  The person asked Jesus a question. I too can ask God questions and know that answers are found in the Bible. The person wanted to have eternal life. How can I know if I will live eternally with Jesus? Do I love God? Can I love Jesus more? How? In Jesus’ parable, two Jewish people didn’t stop to help the Jewish man who was hurt. Do I sometimes not help my friends or my parents? Why don’t I help? Maybe I’m in a hurry? Many it’s inconvenient? Maybe I’m afraid?\n  Then the Samaritan, who historically wasn’t friends with the Jews, decided to stop and help the man. Samaritans and Jews were enemies, but he helped him. Which people groups today don’t really like one another? What does God want me to do when I see that my “enemy” is suffering?\n  Jesus loved me when I was still a sinner and His enemy (Rom. 5:10). He died for me and for all people in the world. Jesus loved me and now I love Jesus and am thankful to Him for salvation and forgiveness and eternal life, I want to love others and show them Jesus’ love. __God, help me to love You and my neighbor. Show me how to love more and give me boldness and strength to love when it is hard.__\n"}</script>

She and her husband gave their son Samuel to God. He lived at the tabernacle, the place of worship and served God with Eli the priest (someone who helps people to worship God). The sons of Eli served at the tabernacle but they didn’t love God and they did bad things. God sent a person to tell Eli that God didn’t like what they were doing and He would punish them. One night, Samuel heard God’s voice calling him. He didn’t understand and thought Eli was calling him. Eli didn’t understand right away that God was calling Samuel. When Samuel heard God’s words to him, he shared them with Eli. God told Samuel what the first person said: that God would judge Eli’s family and their sin against Him. Samuel served God and did what was pleasing to God.

God also speaks to me through His Word, the Bible. I can know what is pleasing to God through His Word. God had a plan for Samuel’s life and God has a plan my life. God saw the sin of Eli’s sons and punished them. God knows everything that I do, think and say. Am I pleasing God in the way that I live? He doesn’t want me to act like I’m worshipping Him when my heart is not really loving Him. Jesus helps me to live God’s way. His Holy Spirit gives me love for God and others (Rom. 5:5).

One of them was: “Then He said: “A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.’ So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.” (Luke 15:11-13) Then when things were really bad for him, he said “I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,  and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”’ But “when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.” And his father threw a part for his son “for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.” (Luke 15:18-24) The father’s older son heard the party and complained to the father that he had never thrown a party for him even though he had always served his father. The father said ““And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.’” (Luke 15:31-32)\nCharacter:\n- God is the Heavenly Father\n- God is generous and loving\n- He is merciful\n- God sees everything\n- God celebrates when people are reconciled to Him\n- God gives life\nApplication: |\n  In His parable, Jesus tells about two sons who represent two kinds of people. The first is the younger son, who didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He took what he could from his father and lived his own way. But later he realized his mistake, repented and by his father’s mercy became a part of the family again. Maybe I am like this son? I want to live my own way and I don’t care what God says, what the Bible says and what people tell me about Jesus. There were a lot of people like that who repented and started to trust God and follow Him in the time when Jesus lived on the earth. They were spiritually dead and far from God but through faith in Jesus they became spiritually alive and close to God. I also can come to the Heavenly Father through faith in Jesus and know that He receives me. I can tell people about Jesus’ love and tell them that God wants to forgive their sin and give them eternal life.\n  But maybe I’m more like the second son. He also didn’t value being a part of his father’s house. He just did what he was suppose to do out of obligation or duty. He thought that he deserved a party because he was obedient but he didn’t know his father. He didn’t want his younger brother to find the father’s mercy and love. He thought that only he, who had lived right should get what was good. He didn’t know the loving heart of his father and he wasn’t glad when his brother who had been “dead” became “alive”. In the time when Jesus lived on the earth there were Pharisees who knew God’s law and fulfilled it well. They thought that they deserved good things from the Heavenly Father. They complained when “sinners” ate with Jesus and He talked with them. They weren’t glad when people who had been “dead” and far from God started to come to God through Jesus and became “alive”. Maybe I also live right and think that I deserve good things from God because of “my righteousness”? In reality, all people sin and everyone needs the righteousness of Jesus to be part of God’s family. Why do I listen to God or my parents or do what is right? Love and thankfulness towards God the Father give me a desire to obey God. When I see the loving heart of God, I want to call everyone to Him so that they would also draw near to God and join the party that God has planned for all those who love Jesus, those that He loves so much!\n"}</script>

Behold, to obey is better than\n  sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.”'\nSummary: |\n  The Israelites asked Samuel to set a king over them. Although God said that they were rejecting Him, He set a king over them. Samuel met Saul when he was looking for his lost donkeys. God told Samuel to anoint Saul as a sign that he was chosen by God to be king. When Saul heard that enemies threatened an Israelite city, the Holy Spirit came upon him and he called all Israel to fight against the enemy. He led the people and God gave them victory and saved them from the enemy.\n  Later,  Saul gathered the army to fight the Philistines, but the people were afraid and hid themselves. Saul did not wait for Samuel and decided to sacrifice an offering to God himself. Samuel told Saul that because of his disobedience, the kingdom would be given to another.\n  1 Sam. 15: Samuel told Saul that God wanted to send him to fight against the Amalekites and get rid of everything and everyone. The Amalekites had been mean to Israel earlier when they were coming out of slavery from Egypt. Saul won the battle but let the Amalekite king and the best of his animals live. Later, Saul put up a memorial to himself. Samuel came and told Saul that he had been disobedient to God. Saul did not admit his guilt right away and tried to explain that what he did was fine. God through Samuel said that obeying God’s voice is more important that offering sacrifices. Samuel also said “you rejected God’s word and He has rejected you, so you won’t be king, but He will set up a new person over Israel.” (1 Sam.15:26) Saul was very upset and said that he had been afraid of the people and that was why he acted that way. When Samuel wanted to leave, Saul grabbed the edge of his clothing and part of it tore off. He really wanted Samuel to go with him to worship God in front of the people. God was sad that Saul was a disobedient king. Samuel continued to pray for Saul.\nCharacter:\n- God is sovereign (God controls everything)\n- Jesus is King of kings and God of all\n- God saves us from our enemies\n- He is Saviour\n- He is worthy of our obedience, respect and trust\n- ' God sees everything'\n- God is our help\nApplication: |\n  The Israelites wanted a king to lead them. God gave them Saul. Leaders can be good but people will always fail.  Jesus is the best King. He is King of kings. I want Him to be the King of my heart. Saul was afraid of what people thought more than what God thought. When I trust Jesus, I don’t need to be afraid of what people think. I should wait to find out what God thinks about a situation and then act according to God’s will. I should listen to King Jesus. Jesus, help me to not fear people’s opinion but to follow and respect You. Show me in Your Word what is pleasing to You and help me to trust You and do it.\n"}</script>

Now behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him,“Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully. But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, “He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.”Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.”And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham; for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:1-10)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus sees all hearts\n- Jesus is loving\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus knows everything and everyone\n- God wants to seek and save us\n- God changes hearts\n- Jesus is God with us\nApplication: |\n  Zacchaeus was a dishonest person who offended many people. He really wanted to see Jesus. He probably heard that Jesus did many miracles and that people called Him Saviour. Jesus knew Zaccheaus’ name and knew that he was watching Him from the tree. He knew that he had stolen money from people. Jesus wanted to be with Zacchaeus and change his life. Jesus sought to spend time with a person that everyone in the town hated. Jesus loved him and wanted to save him. Zaccheaus really changed after spending time (fellowshipping) with Jesus. After he experienced Jesus’ love he became honest and generous instead of selfish.\n  Zacchaeus was looking for Jesus when he climbed the tree, but Jesus was looking for him! Jesus knew his heart and He knows my heart. He knows my sins and how I can be greedy or selfish. He knows my name. He wants to spend time with me. At any time or in any place, I can talk with (fellowship) with Him and not only when I pray, read the Bible or sing worship songs! When I fellowship with Jesus, He changes me! I experience His love and care and He gives me love for others. He fills me with the Holy Spirit and gives me a new heart that loves God and others.\n  Maybe other people see that I fellowship with Jesus and they don’t like it. God’s opinion is most important and not the opinion of people. It’s important to know that Jesus loves me and to also love Him. I want to tell people about Jesus so that they would believe in Him and that He would change their lives. Only Jesus can change a person’s heart. I want to pray for _______________, that like Zacchaeus, they would know Jesus and that God would change him/her just like He changed Zaccheaus. I want to be loving and generous like Jesus and like Zacchaeus. __Jesus, help me to love like You love. Thank you for seeking me, finding me and saving me.

He asked His disciples to get a foal of a donkey from a certain person so that Jesus could ride on it into Jerusalem. By this He fulfilled prophecy from Zech 9:9.\n  Matt 21:6-11: “So the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.They brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him on them. And a very great multitude spread their clothes on the road; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them on the road. Then the multitudes who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: “Hosanna to the Son of David! ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ Hosanna in the highest!” And when He had come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, “Who is this?” So the multitudes said, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is King\n- Jesus is humble\n- Jesus fulfills God’s Word\n- Jesus is worthy of praise\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- He saves\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus is God and King of kings. He is the Only King who is worthy of worship. Many years before Jesus came to earth, the Holy Spirit directed the prophet Zechariah to write that the King and Saviour would come into Jerusalem on a donkey. I see that God fulfills all that He says in His Word. I can trust the Word and God. The Bible is the truth.\n  People worshipped Jesus. They laid  their clothes  and palm branches on the road where He rode and cried out “Hosanna!” which means “Lord, Save!” I also can worship Jesus. I can sing songs to Him, pray to Him and thank Him for salvation. I want to give Him honor because He is worthy! People in Jerusalem heard the noise and asked “who is this?” When I praise Jesus with my life and people ask “who is this Jesus that you are talking about?” I can answer that He is the Saviour and the Eternal King! What does a king do? A good king rules over people; he takes care of them; he makes decisions and he says what is right and wrong; he is the one in charge. Is Jesus my king?

Jesse had eight sons. Samuel thought that the oldest son would be king because he was tall and handsome, “but God told Samuel, don’t look at his appearance and at his height. I have rejected him. I don’t look in the way that people look: for man looks at the face but the Lord looks at the heart.” (1 Sam. 16:7). Finally, they called David, the youngest son who was taking care of the sheep and God told Samuel to anoint him as king. The Holy Spirit filled David from that day and afterwards.\n  Later, in a time of war with the Philistines, Jesse sent David to bring cheese and bread to his brothers who were in Saul’s army. No one was fighting because they were afraid of a big Philistine soldier named Goliath. He wanted to fight with one person from Israel to decide the battle and he said bad things about God.\n  David heard him and trusted God. He decided to fight against him. Saul wanted to give David armor but it was too big for him. David told Goliath “you come against me with sword and spear and shield but I come against you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel who you spoke against (1 Sam. 17:45). He slung a stone at Goliath and he fell. God gave David and Israel victory over the Philistines.\nCharacter:\n- God sees the heart\n- Jesus is the Victor\n- God is our help\n- He is strong\n- He is worthy of praise\nApplication: |\n  God saw the hearts of Jesse’s sons. He knows all my thoughts and feelings. What I believe in my heart about God is very important. It’s important to trust God. How I look or what people think about me is not as important. God is trustworthy. When there are big problems or evil people, I can ask God for help. He will give me strength to stand against evil. Jesus conquered sin and death.

For all things come from You, and of Your own we\n  have given You”\nSummary: |\n  “And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury, and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites. So He said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all; for all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had.” (Luke 21:1-4)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus sees all hearts\n- Jesus knows everyone\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\n- Jesus is King\n- God is a Giver\nApplication: |\n  In this passage, people gave gifts to God. They wanted to say that all that they had was really from God and we give Him what already belongs to Him. They said thank you to Him for providing for them. Jesus saw that some people gave money but they didn’t really think that all that they had was God’s and belongs to Him. But God, that is, Jesus, saw the poor widow and said that even though she didn’t give much money, she actually gave more than the others because she gave out of her poverty and understood that all she had came from God and belongs to Him. She is a good example for me. I know that all I have is from God. I want to use everything for His glory. It’s not right to think that only a part of what I have belongs to God. Jesus, please show me how to use what You have given me. My toys money, clothes, home, time, strength and life is all from God. Jesus, show me how I can praise and thank You for all that You give. Maybe I can give some of my toys to someone. Maybe I can give some of my clothes to an orphanage. I want to have a thankful heart like that widow who trusted God with everything that she had. __Jesus, You gave all for me. You gave Your life for me. Thank you for Your love and care.

Twice, Saul almost caught David, but God helped David to get away. Jonathan came to strengthen his friend David and to remind him that he would be king (1 Sam. 21-23).\n  Again, Saul was looking for David in the mountains. He went into a cave where David was hiding. David could have killed him but instead decided to cut off a corner of Saul’s clothes. When Saul was standing far away, David came out of the cave and showed Saul the cloth. Saul understood that David didn’t want to kill him and went away (1 Sam. 24)\n  David and his people guarded Nabal’s sheep. When Nabal was having a party, they wanted to celebrate with him but Nabal was very rude and David was offended. He wanted to kill Nabal. But Nabal’s wise wife, Abigail, asked David to be merciful. He listened to her. God took Nabal’s life through sickness. Later, David married Abigail (1 Sam. 25)\n  Saul again was looking for David to try to kill him. At night, David went into Saul’s tent and again had a chance to kill him but for the second time, he spared his life. He took a water jug that was near Saul’s head. Then he left and from far away woke everyone up and showed them the jug, so that Saul would know that David didn’t want to kill Saul (1 Sam. 26).\nCharacter:\n- God is our Defender and Avenger (Deut 32:35)\n- God is our help\n- God is faithful\n- He fulfills his promises\n- God sees everything\n- God give us strength\n- God gives wisdom\nApplication: |\n  I can ask help from God to know what to do when things are hard. Just like Abigail, I can share God’s wisdom with people so they would know God’s will (what God wants). Just like David, I can love my enemy and not look for how to get back at them. Jesus gives me strength to not pay back my enemies, but to be kind to them. Jesus died for me when I was a sinner and an enemy of God! He was kind to me before I even loved Him. Jesus will come again and will judge and punish all those who don’t believe in Him. It’s not my job to punish people for the wrong that they do. This is God’s job. __Jesus, help me to love my enemies. Change the heart of my enemies, that they would see your kindness and turn to you for forgiveness.__\n"}</script>

Jesus ate with His friends. He loved them and washed their feet. He said “For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.“ (Jn.13:15-16) Then Jesus explained to the disciples that soon He would die for them. He gave them to drink from the cup and said that the wine was like His blood that He would shed for them. He gave them bread and said that it was like His body that He would give to be broken for them. He told them to drink and eat and “do this in remembrance of Me “ (Luke 22:19). Jesus said that He knew which one of the disciples would betray Him (Jn. 13:21). Judas Iscariot left and betrayed Jesus to those who wanted to kill Him. Jesus told Peter that he would deny Jesus three times. Peter didn’t believe it.\n  That night, Jesus and His disciples prayed in the garden of Gethsemane. But the disciples fell asleep. Jesus prayed to the Father and said  “…Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done “ (Matt. 26:39). Then Judas Iscariot came with soldiers and betrayed Jesus with a kiss. Peter wanted to fight, but Jesus forbid him and even healed the person that Peter hurt. Jesus went with them.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- He is Saviour\n- Jesus chose to lay down His life\n- Jesus knows everything\n- Jesus fulfilled the will of the Heavenly Father\nApplication: |\n  Jesus loved His friends and washed their feet. He said that He gave them an example. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit to help me follow His example to love and serve others. Jesus knew that Judas Iscariot would betray Him but He still loved him and washed his feet too. __Jesus, help me also to love those who don’t love me.__\n  Jesus knew that He would die on the cross. That’s why He prayed to God the Father. He asked His friends to pray with Him. He gave us an example. When things are hard for me or I’m scared, I can pray to the Heaven Father just like Jesus. I also can ask my friends to pray for me and with me. Maybe my friends can’t understand me or give me the support that I need (Jesus’ friends fell asleep!), but Jesus hears my prayers and He is with me. He is my help. He understands me because He also experienced hard times.\n  Jesus chose to fulfill the will of God the Father and fulfill Scripture by dying for my sins. He didn’t hide in the garden; He didn’t run from the soldiers. Even though He could have called angels to fight for Him (Matt. 26:53), He bravely went with the soldiers because He knew that it was God’s plan from eternity and He loved me. I am very thankful to Jesus for His Great Love. Jesus fulfilled the will of the Father and not His own. Then Jesus’ will and the Father’s were the same. Jesus helps me to fulfill His will and not my own. He helps me so that what I want is the same as what God wants. Often, my will is selfish (something that makes only me glad), but God’s will is what makes Jesus glad.__ Jesus, help me to fulfill Your will and serve and love like You. __\n"}</script>

They wanted to kill Him because He said that He is the Son of God and they didn’t believe it. Pilate knew that Jesus wasn’t guilty but he was afraid of what people thought and gave the order to crucify Jesus. During the time of judgement, Peter denied Jesus three times, just as Jesus had said he would. Peter cried. Pilate sent Jesus to Herod. The soldiers were very rude to Jesus and beat Him and laughed at Him. Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. He wanted to release Jesus but the people asked for a criminal to be released instead. They shouted “crucify Him!” and so Pilate agreed to crucify Jesus.\n  Jesus hung on the cross between two thieves. One of them believed that Jesus is the Son of God and Jesus promised that he would be with Him in paradise. When Jesus died, the sky turned dark and the veil in the temple tore from the top to bottom. Jesus said “It is finished!” (Jn 19:30). He died.\n  The disciples saw where Jesus’ body was buried in the tomb of a rich man. The religious leaders asked Pilate for soldiers to guard the grave because they heard Jesus say that He would rise again. They thought that the disciples would take the body and say that He had risen, so they put a very heavy stone in front of the grave to close it.\n  On the third day, just as He said, Jesus rose again! He is alive! The women came to anoint His body but they saw angels that told them that He had risen. The disciples later ran to the grave and saw that He wasn’t there but they didn’t understand that He was alive. Some disciples saw the risen Lord Jesus right away near the tomb.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- He is loving\n- He took my punishment\n- He fulfilled Scripture\n- Jesus is the Victor\n- Jesus is Redeemer and forgives our sins (Col\n- 1:14)\n- Jesus is sinless (2 Cor\n- 5:21, Heb 4:15)\n- Jesus conquered death, sin and the devil\n- (Heb 2:14-15, Rom 6:5-11)\n- Jesus brings us to God (1 Pet 3:18)\n- Jesus is the propitiation for our sin, He satisfies the wrath of God by the sacrifice\n  of Himself (1 Jn\n- 4:10)\n- Jesus loved us and washed us from our sins with His blood (Rev 1:5)\n- Jesus frees us from sin (Rom\n- 6:18 and 8:2)\n- Jesus is my Righteousness (1 Cor\n- 1:30)\n- Jesus proved His love for us (Rom\n- 5:8)\nApplication: |\n  Jesus loves us! He gave His life for us. It was His choice to give His life. I know that Jesus died for my sins and rose again. Only He lived a sinless life and only He can forgive my sin and cleanse me. By faith, He imputes His righteousness to me (attributes His righteousness to me). I trust His Righteousness and know that only by faith in Him, I am saved. I am not saved by good works or good behavior. Jesus saves me by His grace. I want to tell everyone about my Saviour, Jesus! He loves us and wants to give us a heart that loves God and others. He promises to receive me in heaven so that I can be with Him forever! This is GOOD NEWS that everyone needs to hear!\n\n  see also Rom 6:5-11: “For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him, knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more. Death no longer has dominion over Him.  For the death that He died, He died to sin once for all; but the life that He lives, He lives to God. Likewise you also, reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\n\n  *note: between the gospel accounts, there are many details surrounding Jesus’ trial, crucifixion and resurrection. Depending upon the attention span of your group, you may want to omit some details to focus on the big picture.

Jesus walked nearby with them but they didn’t recognize Him (Lk.24:16). Jesus heard their conversation about His resurrection, the empty grave, the angel’s words and what the women saw. He explained to them what is written about Him in Scripture. They came to Emmaus and invited Jesus to eat with them. They started to eat together and when Jesus took the bread to thank God, their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus! Then He disappeared! They decided to hurry back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples that they saw Jesus, even though it was already evening.\n  They told the disciples in Jerusalem that they saw the Risen Lord Jesus and all of the sudden, He appeared in the room with them. At that time, Thomas wasn’t with them and he didn’t believe that the others saw Jesus. He wanted to see the wounds of Jesus himself and be sure that Jesus was alive. After eight days, Thomas was with the disciples and Jesus appeared again. “Then He said to Thomas, “Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing.”  And Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” Jesus said to him, “Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (Jn. 20:27-29).\n  see also Lk 24:44-45\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is alive\n- Jesus fulfills God’s Word\n- Jesus is everywhere\n- Nothing can hinder Jesus\n- He hears and knows everything\nApplication: |\n  I believe that Jesus rose from the dead even though I don’t see Him like His disciples saw Him. Others saw Him and passed on to us the truth that Jesus is alive. Jesus explained that the whole Bible talks about Him (Jn 5:39-40). God said earlier in the Word that He would send a Saviour who would die for everyone’s sins and rise again on the third day. The words of Moses, the prophets and many psalms talk about Jesus. I see that Jesus fulfills these Word of prophecy. I can trust the Bible.\n  Jesus gives those who believe in Him the Holy Spirit (John 20:22-23). I rely upon God’s power to follow after Jesus and to tell others about Him.  The disciples told others that Jesus is alive. I also can tell people, friends and relatives that Jesus is alive. I can tell them that He died for our sins and can forgive us because He paid for our sins (He took our punishment and paid with His blood). Jesus heard that Thomas wanted to touch His wounds. Jesus knows all my thoughts and hears all my words. He doesn’t want me to doubt Him but helps me to trust Him.\n  Jesus promises to raise to life those who believe in Him. The Risen Lord Jesus ate and could appear in rooms that were locked. This was His glorified body. He promises to give each believer in Him a glorified body. That body will never get sick because then there will be no more sin. When we have our glorified body, we will live with Jesus. He already conquered sin but we are waiting for that day when Jesus will return again and take us to be with Him. He gives believers in Him salvation and new life now but we also are waiting for the day when He will save us from this fallen world and give us new life in His presence forever in heaven! While we wait, we can tell everyone that Jesus is alive, that He wants to forgive sins and that He is coming soon to save His own and to punish those who don’t believe in Him. see also 1 Cor. 15:54-57\n"}</script>

He asked God to give him wisdom because he was young and didn’t know how to rule the people. God was pleased with his request and gave Solomon more wisdom than other people. He also promised to give him riches. Once, two women came to Solomon for judgement of their argument about to whom a baby belonged. One of the women lied. Solomon gave the order to cut the child in half but the real mother didn’t want her child to die and was ready to give him to the other woman whereas the other woman wanted him to die. Then Solomon knew who the real mother was and gave the baby to her. The people all saw the wisdom that God gave Solomon.\n  1 Kings 6: Solomon built a temple (a place for worshipping God) in Jerusalem. It was big and beautiful. Many people over many years helped to build the temple.\n  1 Kings 8: The people gathered to worship God when the temple was built. They brought the ark of the covenant into the temple. The priests sacrificed to God and the glory of the Lord in a cloud filled the temple. Solomon prayed to God and thanked Him for fulfilling His Word to the people. He commanded the people to always follow after God and asked God to answer the prayers prayed toward the temple. The people celebrated for 7 days.\n  1 Kings 10: The Queen of Sheba came to Solomon and asked him many questions. Solomon answered her questions and she was amazed at his wisdom. He showed her his kingdom and riches. She was amazed. She gave Solomon a lot of gold and spices and jewels. Solomon gave her all that she wanted and she returned home. Solomon’s kingdom was very beautiful and rich.\n  1 Kings 11: Solomon took many foreign wives and started to worship false gods.\nCharacter:\n- God is wise and gives wisdom\n- ' He is generous'\n- God is holy\n- God is righteous and judges rightly\n- He sees the heart\n- He is worthy of worship\n- God is faithful and fulfills His promises\n- God is rich (in mercy, love and strength)\n- Jesus is King Eternal\nApplication: |\n  Just like Solomon, I can ask for wisdom from God and know that He will give it to me. Jesus helps me live God’s way and to not compromise. I don’t always understand what is right, but God does and His Word tells me what is right. God knows what is in my heart and in the hearts of others.\n  I  want to praise God with my life. I want to live my life for Jesus and be God’s temple (the place where His glory is, where His Holy Spirit is, where He is worshipped). I pray to God and know that he hears me. I come to Jesus for wisdom (just like the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon) and know that God has all the answers. He is a generous King who loves me. I can be generous and share with other people.

Jesus stood on the shore and asked if they had caught any fish. They answered that they hadn’t caught any. He told them to throw their net on the other side and when they did, they suddenly caught a great number of fish. John recognized Jesus on the shore. Peter jumped out of the boat and swam to Jesus. Jesus had already prepared breakfast for them.\n  Later, Jesus and Peter talked. Jesus asked him “… do you love Me more than these?” He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Feed My lambs.” Jesus asked Peter two more times and the last time, Peter answered “Lord!

He met them and helped them miraculously. The miracle with the fish is just like the miracle at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry on earth. He cared for the disciples and prepared breakfast for them. Jesus always knows where I am and what I am doing. He knows my needs. He is my help. He cares for me.\n  Earlier, when Peter was scared, he said three times that he didn’t know Jesus. He was sad and Jesus knew that. Jesus talked separately with Peter and asked Peter three times if he loved Him. Jesus reconciled Peter to Himself. Peter had the opportunity to tell Jesus that He loved Him and understand that Jesus forgave his sin. When I sin, I am not loving Jesus. __Jesus, please forgive me of my sin and help me love You more than anything or anyone else.__\n  Jesus wanted Peter to care for others when He said to him “feed my lambs.” Jesus gives me love for Him and others. Jesus, please show me how to love those around me. There are many people who don’t know about Jesus’ love and care. I can tell them how they can be reconciled with God through faith in Jesus. Jesus gives me the Holy Spirit who strengthens me and pours out God’s love in my heart so I can share about Jesus (Rom 5:5).\n"}</script>

He sent the people his prophet, Elijah, who spoke God’s Word to them. Elijah told king Ahab that there would be no rain in Israel for three years because of the king’s disobedience. Then God told Elijah to go east and live by a river, where there was water. God commanded the ravens to feed Elijah. They brought him bread and meat each morning and evening until the river dried up. Then God sent Elijah to a different city where they didn’t know about God and He promised that there, a widow would feed him. He found the widow there and asked for food. She was very poor and said that she couldn’t feed him because she needed to make bread for her son with her last bit of flour and oil. But God said that the flour and oil wouldn’t run out and she agreed to feed Elijah. God did a miracle and the flour and oil did not run out. Later, the widow’s son got sick and died. She told Elijah and he asked God to raise him to life. God gave the boy life!

And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were confused, because everyone heard them speak in his own language. Then they were all amazed and marveled, saying to one another, “Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?” (Acts 2:1-7).\n  People from all different nations heard the believers speaking about the mighty works of God in their own languages. They gathered together and Peter shared with the people about salvation in Jesus. Many people (3,000!) believed in Jesus that day and they gathered to study the Word, eat together and pray (Acts 2:42). God did miracles through the apostles and ” … continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved” (Acts 2:46-47).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus fulfills His promises\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- The Holy Spirit gives power to share about Jesus\n- Jesus is Saviour of all peoples\n- Jesus forgives sin\n- Jesus is our joy\nApplication: |\n  Jesus gave believers His Holy Spirit just as He promised. The Holy Spirit gave the believers power to witness about Jesus. This passage talks about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I see that Jesus wants to pour out the Holy Spirit on each believer. The Holy Spirit always gives glory to Jesus and not to people. The Holy Spirit helps people to understand that Jesus is Saviour, God and King.\n  __Jesus, fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to share with people about You. Thank you that You are my help. Just as you gave Peter words to share with people, please give me words when I need them. Help me to rely upon You.__\n  Jesus builds the Church. The Church is a group of people who love Jesus and follow Him. I am a part of the Church when I believe in Jesus and fellowship with other believers. People that are part of the Church not only read the Bible and pray but they also love Jesus and one another by sharing their lives with one another. Believers often gather together with one another. Others see our lives and how we love Jesus and one another. Often, they want to know Jesus too after they see this love. __God, bless our church and save even more people through us. __\n  .\n  *Teachers: Please show the children the regions that people came from (Acts 2:9-11) on the map.\n"}</script>

God told Elijah to return to Israel and talk with king Ahab. He gathered all the people and the prophets of Baal (a false god) on Mount Carmel. He said that they would see who the true God is. The people who worshipped Baal would bring a sacrifice to him and Elijah would sacrifice to God. The God who answered with fire from heaven was the true God. The prophets of Baal cried out to him all day long but nothing happened. Then Elijah gathered the people near the altar, dug a ditch around it and poured water over the altar three times until the water filled the ditch.

They helped him to stand on his feet and he started to walk and praise God. Everyone saw that he, who couldn’t walk before, was healed. Peter preached to the people about Jesus and said that Jesus healed, that He died, rose again and forgives the sins of those who believe in Him (Acts 3:19).\n  Acts  4: The priests and other leaders didn’t like it that they were talking about Jesus and the resurrection. They put them in prison. But many people heard about Jesus and around 5,000 people believed! In the morning, Peter and John answered that Jesus healed the person and that “… there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved”(Acts 4:12). The leaders forbid them to speak about Jesus, “But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” (Acts 4:19-20). The leaders let them go and the believers gathered to pray that God would continue to give them boldness “and when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:31)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Healer\n- The Holy Spirit gives boldness and wisdom to speak about Jesus\n- Jesus is our Help\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Only Saviour\nApplication: |\n  On their way to prayer, Peter and John saw the man in need. They gave the man what they could: the good news about Jesus! Jesus can help people. When I see people’s needs, I can tell them that Jesus can help them. A crowd of people saw how the crippled man was healed. Peter and John didn’t want glory for themselves but told everyone that Jesus healed him. They told them about salvation in Jesus. 5,000 people believed because they shared the truth (Acts 4:4).

I want to tell the truth about Jesus so that people would believe in Him.\n  Peter and John knew that the leaders of their city recently crucified Jesus. They put them in prison for their faith in Him. Maybe they thought that the leaders wanted to kill them just like they killed Jesus. But in the morning, when the leaders spoke with them they shared about Jesus with boldness. The leaders weren’t happy but didn’t kill them. Peter and John loved Jesus and wanted to tell the truth about Him. Maybe they were scared but Jesus with the Holy Spirit helped them. Jesus helps me too with His Holy Spirit.

I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am,\n  there you may be also”\nSummary: |\n  1 Kings 19: When Jezebel, the wife of king Ahab heard that the prophets of Baal had been killed, she was angry with Elijah and sent him a message that she wanted to kill him. Elijah got scared and ran away to the south. He wanted to give up and die but God sent an angel who fed him and strengthened him to walk 40 days and 40 nights to Mount Horeb. He found a cave and there heard God’s voice asking him “what are you doing here, Elijah?” He told God that he was the only believer and that he was scared for his life. God showed him a mighty wind, earthquake and fire but the Lord was not in those things. Then there was a soft whisper. God again spoke to Elijah and asked “what are you doing here, Elijah?” Elijah answered the same as before. God sent Elijah north to anoint kings in Syria and Israel. He also wanted Elijah to anoint Elisha to be prophet in his place. God also told him that he wasn’t alone but that there were still 7,ooo people in Israel who had not worshipped the false god, Baal. Elijah found Elisha. Elisha left his old life to fulfill God’s calling.\n\n  2 Kings 2: God was going to take Elijah to heaven in a whirlwind. Elijah travelled to different cities and wanted to leave Elisha but Elisha wanted to stay with him. Many of God’s prophets said goodbye to Elijah, knowing that God would take him to Himself. Elijah and Elisha miraculously crossed the Jordan river. Elijah asked Elisha what he could do for him before he left. He said that he wanted a double portion of his spirit. Elijah answered that if he saw him when he was taken, that it would be so. As they were walking together suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared and God took Elijah up in a whirlwind. Elisha saw it and cried out “my father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel” Then Elisha crossed over the river in a miraculous way again and the other prophets saw that the spirit of God was upon Elisha. They searched for Elijah for three days even though Elisha said that it was useless.\nCharacter:\n- God knows everything\n- He sees all\n- He is caring\n- He is everywhere (omnipresent)\n- God controls history\n- God has a plan to take His own to be with Him\n- God is Holy Spirit\n- God is mighty\n- God has all authority\nApplication: |\n  When people are against me because of my faith in Jesus, I can ask for help and boldness from God to not run away (like Elijah did). I can know that God is with me wherever I go. God will take care of me. God has a plan for me and for His glory. God shows me his plan through His Word. I want to participate in God’s plan and obey Him. Elisha followed Elijah and left his old life behind. I want to completely follow Jesus. When I believe in Jesus, His Holy Spirit lives in me. When I believe in Jesus, I know that He will take me to be with Him in heaven.\n\n  Scriptures for further discussion about God taking us to be with Him and being with Jesus in heaven:\n\n  1 Thess. 4:13-18” But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.”\n  Rev 22:4 ”They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads”\n  Job 19:25-27 ”For I know that my Redeemer lives, and He shall stand at last on the earth; 26 and  after my skin is destroyed, this I know, That in my flesh I shall see God, 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another.

Some people wanted to argue with Stephen but they couldn’t fight with him because he answered wisely. They decided to say bad things about him so that the leaders would kill him. When they judged him, his face was like that of an angel’s. Stephen told them the history of Israel, how God saved them and how they worshipped Him. He told them that they weren’t being obedient to the Holy Spirit and that they killed Jesus, the Just One (Righteous One). The leaders stoned Stephen but Stephen saw Jesus standing in heaven and he said to Him, “Lord, do not charge them with this sin.” and he died. The believers buried him and mourned. They were driven out of Jerusalem and started to live throughout Judea and Samaria. God started to save people in those places through them when they shared about Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is with His people in their suffering\n- Jesus receives His own into glory\n- Jesus turns evil to good\n- The Holy Spirit gives boldness and wisdom to share about Jesus\nApplication: |\n  Stephen loved Jesus and people. He served people in the church and wasn’t afraid to share with people about Jesus. Jesus by the Holy Spirit gave him the words that he spoke to those who accused him. Jesus was near to Stephen when he suffered for his faith in Him. God helped him to love his enemies even when they threw rocks at him. Because he wasn’t afraid to share about Jesus and die for his faith, other believers also continued to share about Jesus and many people were saved.\n  Jesus also gives me the Holy Spirit so I can tell people about Him with wisdom and love. Sometimes people don’t want to hear what I say about Jesus. Jesus gives me love for them even when they may wrongly accuse me. He is with me when I’m having a hard time. He promises to receive me into His kingdom and glory after this life.\n  Through faith in Jesus, God can even turn the difficult things in my life into good and use them to bring more people to Christ. __God, give me love for You and boldness to speak about you and not to fear people.

Once there was a woman who asked Elisha to help her. Her husband had died and people wanted to take her sons as servants to pay off a debt. Elisha told her to find as many vessels as she could. She found a lot. Then the prophet told her to pour oil into the vessels. The oil miraculously didn’t run out until the last vessel was filled. Then the widow sold the oil to pay off the debt.\n  Elisha came to a city where a certain family took care of him. He prayed that God would give them a child. After several years, the child got sick and died. His mother travelled to Elisha but she didn’t tell him that her son died. Elisha quickly went to the boy and prayed that God would bring him back to life. He prayed several times and God brought the boy back to life. God raised him from the dead.\n  Elisha was with some other prophets and their food was bad. He put flour in the food and after that they could eat it. Someone brought 20 loaves of bread to the 100 prophets. But God did a miracle and when they ate, there was enough for everyone. They were full and there was even bread left over.\n\nCharacter:\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God is glorious and wonderful\n- ' God loves to do the impossible'\n- He is Provider\n- God is caring\n- God hears us\n- Jesus gives the Spirit to believers\nApplication: |\n  Before Elijah was taken up to God, Elisha asked for God’s Spirit to be upon him (2 Kings 2:9). God answered his prayer and did many miracles through Elisha. Through these miracles, God blessed and cared for people in amazing ways. God can use ordinary things (flour and oil) and ordinary people (Elisha, you and me) for His glory, so that people would see that He is great! Jesus gives the Holy Spirit to believers to help them love God and tell others about Him. I can ask Jesus to fill me with the Holy Spirit and to be glorified in my life (Lk.11:13).\n  God raised the boy from the dead. This reminds me of Jesus. Jesus brings life from death. He rose from the dead and He gives life to those who are dead in sin and promises to raise believers from the dead (Rom.8:11). That is a great miracle! He showed His great love for us when He died for us, so that we can have life in Him.  There are many people around me who are spiritually dead. __Jesus, help me to tell them about the life that you can give them!__\n"}</script>

See also 2 Tim 4:2, 1 Pet. 3:15 about being ready to share about Jesus.\n  Phillip was a Jew and the Ethiopian was from a different people group. Philip knew that Jesus is the Saviour of all people. I know that Jesus is the Saviour of all peoples and I want to share about Him not only with people from my group but with all those that God wants me to share with.\n  The Ethiopian was seeking God. He didn’t know about Jesus but he knew that the Word of God was important and he worshipped God. God revealed Himself to him and he came to know Jesus! He was ready to be baptized when he saw water. He wanted to show his faith in Jesus and identify himself with the death and resurrection of Jesus to show that he received forgiveness from Jesus and that by His grace he was given new life (see Rom. 6:1-11). __Jesus, I want to know you more. Help me to understand Your Word, to grow in my love for you and to worship You with my life. Help me to understand how baptism shows others how believers have died to the old self and have new life in You. Jesus, You are the Saviour of all people all over the world. Please save more people and use me to tell people about Your Love and salvation.__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

Freely you have\n  received, freely give.”'\nSummary: |-\n  Naaman was a famous successful soldier in the land of Israel’s enemies but he had a terrible skin disease. Once, he took captive a girl from Israel and she served his wife. The girl shared about a prophet in Israel who could help Naaman. The king of Syria wrote a letter to the king of Israel about Naaman but the king of Israel didn’t know how to help Naaman and was upset. The prophet Elisha heard about it and said that Naaman could come to him. Naaman came to Elisha on his chariot with lots of people and expensive gifts but the prophet didn’t even come out of his house to meet him and told him to wash seven times in the Jordan river.\n  Naaman thought that this was foolish and simple. He didn’t want to do it but his servant said, that really what the prophet told him to do wasn’t hard. The prophet told him to wash and then he would be clean and healthy. Naaman washed seven times and on the seventh time, according to the Word of God, he became clean! He wanted to give Elisha a lot of presents but Elisha wouldn’t take anything from him. Naaman said that now he would only worship God. After this he started on his way home but Elisha’s servant Gehazi caught up to Naaman and lied to him so that he could get some presents from him. He got the gifts and hid them but God showed Elisha what Gehazi had done and gave the skin disease that had been on Naaman to him.\nCharacter:\n- God is Healer\n- God sees everything\n- God is merciful\n- God is glorious\n- God shows us His glory\n- God is the Lord of all people\n- God freely gives us His grace\nApplication: |\n  God showed grace and mercy to Naaman. He freely healed him. Elisha didn’t take gifts from Naaman so that he would understand this about God. Jesus freely saves me by His grace. I can’t do anything to deserve or earn His kindness. I can follow Elisha’s example and help people without expecting anything in return. I can follow the little girl’s example and tell people about the greatness of my God. I can also follow Naaman’s example and come to God for healing from sickness and for cleansing from sin.  But I better not follow Gehazi’s example, being sneaky and greedy. This is sin. God sees everything and I can never deceive Him. When I sin, I can ask forgiveness from Jesus and ask Him to help me to be honest, loving and giving. Jesus, help me to understand your grace that you freely give me.\n"}</script>

He went to Damascus with a letter to arrest all the believers in Jesus. On the road there, a light from heaven shone on him. “Then he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” And he said, “Who are You, Lord?” Then the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.It is hard for you to kick against the goads.” So he, trembling and astonished, said, “Lord, what do You want me to do?” Then the Lord said to him, “Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do” (Acts 9:4-6). He was blind and couldn’t see for three days. God told Ananias to go to Saul. He was afraid, “But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel” (Acts 9:15). He went to pray for Saul and God opened his eyes. Saul was baptized and was with the believers and started to teach in the synagogue that Jesus is God and Saviour. Then some people didn’t agree and wanted to kill him. The believers there, “took him by night and let him down through the wall in a large basket.” (Acts 9:25). Later, Saul was in Jerusalem and at first, people didn’t believe that he was a believer in Jesus. But Barnabas befriended him. Saul continued to tell people that Jesus is God and Saviour. Again, people wanted to kill him. His friends sent him to Tarsus (his hometown).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is God and Saviour\n- God calls us\n- God has a plan for our lives\n- Jesus changes hearts and lives\nApplication: |\n  Saul (later Paul) didn’t believe in Jesus and wanted to stop believers in Him. People were afraid of him because he was mean and hurt believers in Jesus. But God had a plan for his life and He saved Saul. Do I know someone who is angry towards believers in Jesus? Do I believe that God has a good plan for that person’s life and can save him? God can!\n  Even though Ananias was afraid to go to Saul, he was obedient when God called him to go to him. God let Ananias see His big work in Saul’s heart! Does God want me to talk about Jesus with someone?__ Jesus, help me to be obedient when you call me to share about You.__\n  Jesus changed Saul! He can change me and other people. At first, Saul told everyone that Jesus was neither God nor Saviour. Later, he told everyone that Jesus is God and Saviour. Some people were angry at Saul when he talked about Jesus but he continued to share. Jesus, give me boldness and wisdom to share about Your salvation and love with people. Saul was living his own way until Jesus changed his heart. Later when Jesus led his life, he travelled a lot and told lots of people in the world about Jesus. I don’t want to live life my way. I want Jesus to lead my life. __Jesus, I trust You and Your plan for my life. __\n  See also 2 Tim. 1:9, Eph. 1:18, Eph. 4:1, Phil 3:14, 1 Thess. 2:12 about God’s calling\n\n  *Teacher!

Jonah got on a boat going the opposite direction. God sent a storm on the sea. The sailors found out that the storm was because of Jonah’s disobedience to God. He told them that he believed in the Lord God who made the heavens, the sea and the land. They were afraid of God’s wrath and did what Jonah said then he told them to throw him into the sea. Then the sea was calm and the sailors worshipped God.\n  Jonah 2 God told a big fish (whale) to swallow Jonah and he was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights. Jonah prayed to God and said that “Salvation is from the Lord.” The Lord told the whale to spit Jonah out on land.\n  Jonah 3: The Lord told Jonah a second time to go to Nineveh to speak His Word there. Jonah decided to listen and told the people of the city that in 40 days, God would destroy their city. The people listened, believed God’s Word and repented. The king told people to fast and to turn from their evil ways and ask God for mercy. God saw what they did, when they turned from their evil ways and He decided to show them mercy.\n  Jonah 4: But Jonah was upset and annoyed by this. He didn’t want God to show them mercy. Jonah sat overlooking the city. God made a plant grow over his head to give him shade from the sun and Jonah was glad. But later, God sent a wind to dry up the plant. Jonah was upset and wanted to die. God showed him that it wasn’t right that Jonah felt bad about the plant and didn’t feel bad for the people of Nineveh who didn’t understand right from wrong.\nCharacter:\n- God is merciful\n- God is Lord of all people\n- God sees the heart\n- He is Creator of heaven, earth and the sea\n- God punishes sin\n- God warns people about His wrath\n- God loves to forgive sin\n- God is gracious\nApplication: |\n  God was merciful to the Ninevites and to Jonah. I can’t run away from God like Jonah wanted to. It’s dangerous to be disobedient to God. God forgives me and saves me when I call out to Him. I know that Jesus wants to save all people, even people who seem to be my enemies. God wants people to turn to Jesus.  Jonah wasn’t glad, but I can be glad about God’s plan to save people. Maybe God wants me to tell my enemies about salvation in Jesus. Help me to remember that I don’t deserve your kindness, no one does, but that’s why the gospel is such good news!  Jesus, please  give me a compassionate heart for unbelievers and help me to share Your love and mercy with them and to warn them of God’s wrath.\n  Jesus spoke about Jonah and said “For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.” Luke 11:30.  and “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” Matt. 12:40.

God sent an angel to him and told him to call Peter. Peter was a Jew and didn’t socialize with Gentiles. God showed him a vision when he prayed and said, “What God has cleansed you must not call common (unclean)” (Acts 10:15). Peter didn’t understand, but when people from Cornelius came looking for him, God told Peter to go with them. Peter and some other Jewish believers went to Cornelius’s house where many people (Gentiles) were gathered. Cornelius wanted to bow to Peter, but he raised him up and said “I also am just a man.” (Acts 10:26)\n  Cornelius wanted to hear a message from God. Peter understood that he should share with them about salvation in Jesus and that they weren’t “unclean Gentiles” but were people that Jesus wanted to save. When he shared about Jesus, the Holy Spirit came down on the Gentiles because they believed in Jesus. Peter and his friends were amazed that God gave the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit, just as He had given them. Then they were baptized in the name of Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour of all peoples\n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is a gift for every believer in Jesus\n- God cleanses those who were unclean\n- God hears prayer\n- Jesus is worthy of worship\n- God is merciful\nApplication: |\n  Cornelius didn’t know much about God but worshipped Him and God heard his prayer and sent Peter to tell him about salvation in Jesus. The Jews thought that salvation in Jesus and the gift of the Holy Spirit was only for them but God showed them that salvation and the gift of the Holy Spirit is for every person who believes in Jesus. Cornelius invited many people to his house so they could hear from God. God saved many people that day when they heard about Jesus. Like Cornelius, I too want to seek God, love Him and invite people to hear about Jesus. I want to trust Jesus and worship Him. From this passage, I know that salvation in Jesus is for all who believe in Him!\n  Peter didn’t understand God’s plan right away. He didn’t understand the vision he saw, but he was obedient to God when He sent him to Cornelius. Later, Peter understood that God wanted to save the Gentiles. Sometimes when I pray and read the Bible, I don’t understand everything but God shows me what to do. Jesus, help me to do what your Word says and trust You even when I don’t understand everything. Peter told the people about Jesus; God saved them and poured out His Holy Spirit on them. I believe that today God wants to save people and use me to tell them about Jesus. __Jesus, show me who to share with and how. Fill me with the Holy Spirit and help me to tell people that You are the Only Saviour!__\n  In the Bible, I see God’s plan to save everyone. He gave His law to the Jews and made a special covenant with them. He always wanted them to be a light to other nations so that the nations would see that God is the only true God. He sent His Son Jesus to the Jews. Jesus was a Jew and fulfilled God’s law which the Jews knew. It was always God’s plan that all believers in Jesus would be saved and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. God is merciful! __Thank you, Jesus, that you saved me and died for me on the cross. You rose again and You are alive and You are the Saviour of the world!__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

God allowed this because they didn’t listen to Him and worshipped idols. God sent them prophets but they didn’t listen to them. They didn’t want to follow God’s Word.\n  2 Kings 25: The Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem and destroyed the temple and the beautiful houses. He led the people away to captivity in Babylon.\n  Jeremiah 25:11-12: God told the people that they would be in captivity for 70 years and then God would punish Babylon.\n  Isaiah 44: God said that it’s foolish to worship idols that are made by people. He also promised to return the people to their land.\n  Daniel 1: Nebuchadnezzar took many people away from Judah when he conquered it. Daniel and his friends were some of those people. King Nebuchadnezzar had a special plan for Daniel and his friends. He wanted them to serve in his kingdom and wanted them to study the ways for Babylon for three years. He also gave them food from his table. But Daniel and his friends couldn’t eat the king’s food because it wasn’t clean according to God’s law. God gave them favor with the person in charge of them when Daniel asked to only eat vegetables and drink water. He decided to test them for 10 days and the Babylonians saw that Daniel and his friends looked better than those who were eating the king’s food. Daniel and his friends continued to study and God gave them wisdom and knowledge. At the end of the three years, the king tested them and saw that Daniel and his friends were the best.\n  King Nebuchadnezzar had a troubling dream. He wanted to know what it meant. He wanted his wise men to tell him his dream and if they couldn’t, he would kill all of the wise men. Daniel and his friends prayed to God for help. God told Daniel the the king’s dream and it’s meaning. In the dream there was a big statue made of different metals. In the end, a big rock destroyed the statue and became big mountain that filled the earth. Daniel explained that the different metals were different kingdoms. The big Rock was God’s eternal kingdom that would destroy all the other ones and rule forever. Nebuchadnezzar said that Daniel’s God was the best and rewarded Daniel and his friends with good jobs serving him.\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is wise\n- God gives mercy, wisdom and grace\n- God is always with us (omnipresent)\n- God is a glorious King\n- God’s kingdom is eternal\nApplication: |\n  The people in Israel and Judah lived their own way. They worshipped idols and did evil things.  God sent many prophets to warn the people and ask them to return to loving Him alone. He punished them by sending them into exile. This showed them that life without God is painful. But God promised to bring His people back to their land. He took care of His people that loved and trusted Him.\n  Daniel and his friends trusted God and did what was pleasing to Him. They loved God and that’s why they didn’t want to eat the king’s food.  Jesus, help me to follow You even when “important” people are telling me to do something else. People saw that following God was good. Jesus is glorified (seen as great) in my life when I love and follow Him.\n  Daniel knew that God knows everything and that He rules over everything and controls everything. He knew that God could tell him the king’s dream. The king then understood that God is the greatest. When I follow Jesus and look to Him for help, others see that He is great. Jesus is the big rock in the king’s dream that will get rid of all the other kingdoms and rule forever. He is big and strong and He rules over everything and everyone__. Jesus, help me to remember that you are King over all. I want to follow You because Your kingdom is forever.__\n"}</script>

The church was praying for him. “And when Herod was about to bring him out, that night Peter was sleeping, bound with two chains between two soldiers; and the guards before the door were keeping the prison. Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the prison; and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, “Arise quickly!” And his chains fell off his hands” (Acts 12:6 -7).

The friends of Daniel: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were there. They loved God and decided not to worship the idol. Other people complained about them to the king. The king gave them another chance to bow to the idol and if not, they would be thrown into the fiery furnace. But they said that their God could save them and even if He did allow them to die, they wouldn’t worship the idol. The king got angry and heated the furnace seven times hotter. It was so hot that those who threw Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego into the furnace died from the heat. Then the king saw that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego didn’t die but that God saved them and that even One who looked like the Son of God was with them in the fire. The king told them to come out and saw that even their hair and clothing was not burned by the fire. Then the king praised God and wanted all his people to respect God (Dan. 3:28-29).\nCharacter:\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- God hears everything\n- God sees everything\n- God is jealous\n- He is Saviour\n- He is with us\n- He is worthy to be praised\n- He is God of everyone in the whole world\nApplication: |\n  Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were in a very difficult situation.

They sent them off and they travelled and shared with people about Jesus. They went to Cyprus and shared about Jesus on the whole island. There was a false prophet there, who was against the Good News. God blinded him for a time; people saw the miracle and believed in Jesus and the Word. Then they sailed to Pamphylia and shared in the synagogue (where the Jews read the Old Testament) and Paul preached Jesus and explained that the Old Testament talks about Jesus. Some of the Jews believed and even the Gentiles believed, “And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region“ (Acts 13:49). Then some unbelieving Jews drove Paul and Barnabas away. They continued on their way, “And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit“ (Acts 13:52).\n  In Iconium, they also shared in the synagogue and many Jews and Gentiles believed. The unbelieving Jews and Gentiles wanted to stone them but they left and went to Lycaonia. In the city of Lystra, Paul healed a crippled man in the name of Jesus. People thought that Paul and Barnabas were gods and wanted to sacrifice to them. But Paul explained that there is only one God who made heaven and earth and that they should worship Him. Then the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles stoned Paul. The believers prayed for him and he got up and continued on his way. In every place they prayed and fasted that God would show them who should be leaders there. They later returned to the church in Antioch, where they started from, “Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles” (Acts 14:27).\nCharacter:\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus is God\n- He is Saviour of all\n- The Holy Spirit speaks\n- He sends believers out according to His plan\n- God directs\n- God alone is worthy of worship\n- Jesus fills believers with joy and the Holy Spirit\nApplication: |\n  The believers in Antioch prayed and worshipped God. The Holy Spirit spoke to them and told them what to do, so they prayed for Paul and Barnabas and sent them off to fulfill God’s calling. I also can pray with believers and hear from the Holy Spirit. Today also, God sends people from the church to share about Jesus with people who still haven’t heard about Him. I want to be obedient to the Holy Spirit and share with people about Jesus in my homeland and beyond it’s borders and even to the ends of the earth. I want to support (in prayer etc.) those whom God sends out for missions from my church.\n  When Paul and Barnabas shared about Jesus, some people believed in Him and others didn’t. Some became a part of the church (a group of believers in Jesus) and others wanted to stop them and kick them out. There will always be different reactions (responses) towards Jesus. I know that Jesus wants to save everyone but not everyone will love Jesus. People who don’t love Jesus also won’t love me. It’s important that I know: Jesus loves me and loves them. That’s why I want to tell people about Him. People without Jesus will perish (die without hope) but God doesn’t want people to perish. __Jesus, help me to share about You. Give me boldness to share even when people don’t receive You. Thank you that You are always with me even when it’s scary and people want to kick me out because of my faith in You.

The king was thinking about making Daniel head over the kingdom. There were some people who envied Daniel and wanted to get rid of him. But Daniel was a god-fearing person and they couldn’t find anything bad in him. Then they made a plan and gave the king an idea to make a law that for 30 days, people could only pray to the king (not to God). But Daniel loved God and continued to pray to God alone even when he heard about the law. The tricky people caught Daniel when he was praying and as a punishment threw him into the lion’s den.  The king wanted to free Daniel but he couldn’t change his law. He said “may your God save you!” That night, the king couldn’t sleep and in the morning he came to the lion’s den to see if Daniel was still alive. Daniel said “God sent an angel who closed the mouth of the lions.” God saved Daniel because he believed in God. Later, the king commanded that all people in his kingdom should fear God and know that He saves.\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King Eternal\n- His Kingdom is Forever\n- God is worthy of worship\n- God is Protector\n- God hears our prayers\nApplication: |\n  Daniel served before many different kings when he lived in Babylon. He saw that their kingdoms were only for a time. He knew that God is the great King and that His kingdom was forever. He followed God above all and did not compromise when man’s law contradicted (went against) God’s law. God showed Daniel that the Messiah’s kingdom would never end (Dan. 2:44) and showed him what would happen before Jesus’ kingdom was fully established (Dan. 9).\n  It may happen that evil people don’t like me and want to get me into trouble. I can trust God and follow Him like Daniel did. Even if they do something bad to me, Jesus is with me and I know that I belong to Him and His kingdom. Earthly kingdoms will all end someday, but Jesus’ kingdom is forever.\n"}</script>

Against such there\n  is no law.” or Eph. 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that\n  not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.”\nSummary: |\n  Paul and Barnabas were in an area called Galatia (Acts 14). They heard that some of the believing Jews told the believing Gentiles that they should keep the whole law if they wanted to be real believers in Jesus (Gal 1:6). Paul wrote a letter to the believers in Galatia so they would remember that all people are saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in His righteousness and not by keeping the law (which is impossible). Only Jesus (who is God and man) fulfilled the whole law (Rom. 8:3-4). Paul wrote, “knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by faith in Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified” (Gal 2:16). Believers understand that Jesus fulfilled the whole law and gives them new life. “For I through the law died to the law that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me. “ (Gal. 2:19-20).\n  In Gal. 5, Paul writes that believers should walk in the Spirit (that is, follow Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit). “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.” (Gal. 5:22-23) When a person belongs to Jesus (through faith in Him), he won’t live according to his selfish desires but will live by the Spirit and act according to the Spirit (Gal. 5:24). In Gal. 6, he writes that believers don’t boast in their deeds or in how they fulfill the law which doesn’t save them. They boast in Christ Jesus and in what He accomplished on the cross (Gal. 6:14).\n  In Jerusalem, there was a church council where they discussed the question of salvation for the Gentiles (Acts 15). They all agreed that Jesus saves everyone by grace and that the law doesn’t save. That’s why it wasn’t right to teach people to fulfill the law for salvation. They wrote the Gentile believers a letter where they explained this. Then Paul and Silas returned to Galatia to see the believers and tell them that truly, they are all saved through faith in Jesus Christ and not through works of the law. (Acts 16:1-6).\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- He fulfilled the whole law\n- Jesus gives believers new life\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- God gives love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness\n  and self-control from the Holy Spirit\n- The Holy Spirit helps believers to live God’s way\nApplication: |\n  Jesus saves me and everyone who believes in Him by grace. Trying to fulfill the law doesn’t save me. I am wrong if I think that God will accept me if I do good works. God accepts those who put their faith in the perfect life, sacrifice and victory of Jesus. I trust in the righteousness of Jesus and not my “righteousness”. When I believe in Him, by grace, He forgives my sin and gives me a new heart that loves God and others. He gives me the Holy Spirit, who lives in me and helps me to live pleasing to God. The fruit of the Holy Spirit is love. When I love Jesus (and He helps me to love Him), then just like an apple tree that grows apples, so my life and my heart will be filled with love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. I can ask Jesus to grow the fruit of the Holy Spirit in my life and that I would love Him and others more and more.\n  What does the fruit of the Holy Spirit look like? What do these look like:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? What examples of each one can I think of? Jesus is God and He showed us all of the fruit of the Spirit. Which examples from the life of Jesus can I remember that are examples of:  love, joy, peace, patience,  kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control? __Jesus, please grow the fruit of the Spirit in my life.__\n\n  *Teacher!

The people returned and started to rebuild the temple and altar. They were stopped but then after some years, another king told them that they could build again. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah encouraged people to build. They finished rebuilding the temple and starting worshipping God there. They celebrated Passover.\n  Still, there were many Jews who lived in the lands of their captivity and didn’t return to the land of Israel. Esther was a Jewess, who lived in the city of Susa, in the Persian Empire, where Ahasuerus was king (in some texts: Artaxerxes).\n  During a celebration, King Ahasuerus  asked his wife to come and dance for his guests. She refused and the king decided to take away her crown and find a new queen. There was a contest in the land and Esther, who was Jewish, became the new queen. Her uncle Mordechai worked for the king. He heard of a plan to kill the king and saved him. Haman was a prince in the land and wanted everyone to worship him. When he passed by Mordechai, he wanted him to bow to him. but Mordechai would only worship God. Haman got angry when he saw that Mordecai wouldn’t bow to him. He decided to kill Mordecai and all the Jews. He tricked the king into planning a certain day when all the Jews in his kingdom could be killed. Mordechai found out about this and tore his clothes as a sign of suffering and sadness. He spoke with Esther and asked her to talk with the king about her people. But Esther knew that if she went to the king without being invited, she could be killed. Mordechai said,“Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14) Esther asked that all the Jews would fast for their salvation and decided to risk her life and said “if I perish, I perish!” (Esther 4:16). She came to the king and he received her. She asked him and Haman to dinner. Before dinner, the king found out how Mordechai had earlier saved his life and commanded Haman to reward him. Later, at dinner (the second time), the king asked Esther how he could help her. She told him Haman’s plan to kill her people. The king killed Haman and helped the Jews to defend themselves against those who wanted to kill them. God saved his people and gave Mordechai all of Haman’s property.\nCharacter:\n- God is Saviour\n- God is Defender\n- He sees everything\n- He is our Help\nApplication: |\n  Mordechai and Esther believed God and served the king when it was a difficult time for their people. God gave them influence and a high position so that they could help people. Maybe God has put me in a special place at a special time so that I can tell people about Jesus? God gives me boldness and wisdom to tell people about Jesus at home, at school and everywhere where people need to hear the truth. I trust in Jesus and know that He is the Saviour of all who trust in Him. It is worth it to risk it all (just as Esther did) when Jesus calls me to do something for Him for the sake of truth.\n  The Jews fasted and prayed before Esther went to talk with the king. When people fast, they feel hungry because their body needs food. When believers in Jesus fast, they are reminded that their hearts and souls need God. They draw near to God when they fast and look to Him to fill them up, not with food, but with His strength, love and wisdom. When believers fast, they humble themselves (make themselves low) and remember that they are dependent upon God (who is great!) for everything in life!\n\n  *fun facts: 1) the city of Susa is in modern day Iran 2) King Darius from Daniel ch. 6 is the father of King Ahasuerus (Xerxes or Artaxerxes) in Esther. 3) the name of God is not mentioned directly in the book of Esther but some see it in acrostic form in the original text. that is, God’s name is hidden in the text. Letters spelling YHWH are in certain verses(Esther 1:20, 5:4, 13, 7:7). Although His name is hidden, God is the Saviour and Defender in this story.\n\n  Resources with historical information about these the books of Esther, Ezra and Nehemiah:\n  http://www.raystedman.org/bible-overview/highlights/the-way-back-ezra-nehemiah-esther\n  amazingbibletimeline.com\n  http://biblehub.com/timeline/ezra/1.htm\n  https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/guzik_david/StudyGuide_Est/Est_1.cfm\n  http://www.ancient.eu/susa/\n"}</script>

There, a lady named Lydia and her family believed in Jesus (Acts 16:14-15). They all gathered at the river to pray (Acts 16:13). Once, on the way there, they met a demon-possessed servant girl. Her master used her to make money (the demon in her would guess people’s future). The girl followed Paul and the others saying “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation” (Acts 16:17).  After hearing this for many days, Paul drove the demon out of her in the name of Jesus Christ. The master of the girl was angry because he couldn’t make money with her any more and complained to the leaders of the city about Paul and Silas. They beat them and put them in prison.\n  At night, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praise songs to God and all the prisoners heard them. Then there was an earthquake and the doors of the prison opened. The jailer wanted to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had run away, but Paul stopped him. The jailer wanted to know how to be saved. Paul and Silas said “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” (Acts 16:31) The jailer led them out and his whole house heard the Word of the Lord. The jailer washed Paul and Silas’s wounds and his household believed in Jesus and was baptized. Then they ate. In the morning, the city leaders released Paul and Silas from prison. Paul said that they put them in prison unjustly and asked that the leaders come themselves to lead them out of prison. Then Paul and Silas went to Lydia’s house, to the believers in Jesus.\nCharacter:\n- God is worthy of praise\n- Jesus is God\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus gives freedom\n- God is wise and kind\n- Jesus gives joy amidst trials\nApplication: |\n  Paul, Silas and the others travelled to tell people about Jesus. I also can look for people who don’t know about Jesus, to tell them about His love and salvation. Where can I share about Jesus? I can share in school, at home, on the street, at the playground and even in other countries. Paul and the others met a demon possessed servant girl. In the name of Jesus, she was freed from the demon. Only Jesus can free a person. He is God and He controls everything. People who don’t believe in Jesus are under the control of sin and Satan. They don’t know what true freedom in Jesus Christ is. I can tell them that Jesus wants to give them forgiveness and freedom. Only through faith in Jesus a person can be free from sin and the influence of Satan (who is a fallen angel and always obeys what Jesus tells him to do when Jesus tells him to stop or leave).\n  For their act of kindness, Paul and Silas were put in prison! I always think that people in prison aren’t free but because Paul and Silas were believers their hearts were free and they could be joyful and sing songs to Jesus. The others heard them. When I suffer unjustly, I can still be joyful because I know that Jesus is with me. Even when I am suffering, I can praise Jesus and those around me will see that Jesus is my help, my strength and my joy.\n  God opened the doors of the prison. Through this miracle, Paul and Silas could share about Jesus with the jailer and his household. They all heard the Word of the Lord and believed in Jesus. People need to hear the truth about Jesus from the Bible. I can share with them what I know about Jesus from the Bible. I can tell them that only through faith in Jesus, we are saved.\n  To be in prison because of my faith in Jesus seems scary. But I see how everything works for good. That is, because Paul and Silas were in prison and sang songs to Jesus, the jailer and his family heard about Jesus and God saved them! I don’t always understand how God works, but I can trust Him. I believe that He is wise and kind and that He has a good plan for me and others. __Jesus, help me to be joyful in You always and tell people that You are the Great Saviour! When I’m in a hard situation, help me to remember that you work all things for good!__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

(see also 2 Chron. 36:22-23, Isaiah 44:28)\n  Ezra 2:Many people returned to Israel\n  Ezra 3: People build an altar in Jerusalem and celebrated (they remembered how God had taken care of them when they came out of slavery in Egypt and into the promised land). Then they rebuilt the foundation of the temple in Jerusalem so that they could worship God there again. They praised God with songs.\n  Ezra 4-6: the enemies of God wrote a letter to the new king so that the Israelites would stop rebuilding and the work stopped. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah spoke God’s Word to the people that they should continue rebuilding the temple. “Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’Says the Lord of hosts.” (Zechariah 4:6) The people wrote a letter to the new king, Darius and asked for his permission. God gave a command through Darius and he told them that they could continue the work. The people were obedient to God’s word that the prophets spoke and started to rebuild the temple.\n\n  Ezra 7-8: Ezra “came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.” (Ezra 7:9-10). The king gave Ezra a special letter promising him help for teaching people to worship God. Many people decided to go back to Jerusalem with Ezra. They brought a lot of silver and gold articles for worship in the temple. They prayed and fasted to God for a safe journey and God answered their prayer (Ezra 8:21-23, 31).\n\n  Ezra 9-10:  Ezra heard that some people had married women who didn’t love God but who worshipped idols. He tore his clothes, pulled some hair from his beard, sat down in shock and didn’t eat until evening time. He prayed to God, admitting that the people were guilty. He reminded the people that God had sent them into exile and that in His mercy had brought them back to the land. Many people gathered around Ezra and started crying and confessing their sin (Ezra 10:1-2). They decided to promise to follow God and not to have the wives that didn’t love God.  They gathered together on a very rainy day and decided to follow God.\nCharacter:\n- God fulfills His Word\n- God is our help\n- God is Holy\n- God is merciful\n- He answers prayer\n- God has all authority\n- God is worthy of worship\nApplication: |\n  God promised to bring the people back to the land. I know that when God promises something, He will fulfill His Word. The Bible is God’s Word and it is true. Jesus helps me to fulfill God’s Word just as God helped the people to rebuild the temple when He commanded them to do so. Sometimes, people stand in the way of God’s work but nothing can stop God.\n  Ezra was sad when he heard that people were not following God’s Word (when they married women who didn’t love God). The people were convicted of sin (realized that they were guilty), they confessed it (admitted their sin to God), they repented and obeyed God’s Word (followed God).\n  *Idea for teaching: use gestures to teach the key words: convicted, confession, repentance and obedience. Convicted (strike your heart with your finger, like an arrow is piercing it), Confession (touch your mouth and then bring your hand away from your mouth to show a speaking action), Repentance (turn around from facing one way), Obedience (take a step in the new direction).\n  Has God’s Word ever convicted me of sin? Jesus calls me to confess, repent and obey. He is my help and He is ready to forgive me and give my strength by His Holy Spirit to follow Him!\n  __ Thank you God for Your love and mercy that You show me in Jesus Christ. I want to follow You.__\n"}</script>

They were in Ephesus. The first time, Paul was there for a short time but other believers stayed there (Acts 18:18-21). Then he went back and was with the believers there for three years (Acts 20:31).\n\n  The Letter to the Ephesians: Paul wrote a letter to the church while he was in prison (Eph 3:1, 4:1, 6:20). Most of the believers in the Ephesian church were Gentiles. (Eph. 2:11-22).\n\n  Spiritual Blessings: In Jesus Christ, believers have every spiritual blessing in the heavens. That means that in Jesus, God gives believers: holiness, makes them His children, gives them forgiveness, promises them an inheritance in heaven and seals them with the Holy Spirit (1:1-14).\n  \n  Saved by Grace: “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast” (Eph 2:8-9). Earlier, we were all under the influence of sin and were God’s enemies. But now, in Jesus each believer is a new creation of God that fulfills the plans that God has for them. (Eph. 2:10)\n  \n  Unity in Christ: Jesus makes Jewish and Gentile believers one in Himself. They aren’t divided anymore. (Eph. 2:14-16) Jesus is the head of believers and they make up a body where each one does their part and grow in love. (Eph. 4:15-16)\n  \n  Believers love and respect one another: Believers should follow the example of Jesus. The Holy Spirit changes them (Eph. 4:20-24). “And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you.” (Eph. 4:32). In all their relationships, believers should love and respect one another: husbands and wives, children and parents, workers and bosses. (Eph. 5:21-6:9)\n  \n  Jesus helps believers to stand in truth (and against the devil): Believers should, “be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.” (Eph. 6:10) Jesus gives believers all that they need to stand safe in the truth (Eph. 6:10-20). Jesus gives believers protection (the armor of God). This protection is: truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, salvation and the Word of God. All these help the believer to stand in the truth of their: 1)spiritual blessings 2)their salvation by grace 3) their unity with other believers in Christ 4) their love and respect for others.\n\n  Jesus gives us all that we need to stand against the devil. Believers pray in the Spirit for one another that God would help them to boldly share the Good News of Jesus (Eph. 6:18-20).\n\n \nCharacter: \n- Jesus is God\n- The Holy Spirit is God\n- Jesus saves by grace\n- Jesus makes all believers one in Him\n- Jesus is the head of the Church\n- Jesus is our Protection\n- 'Jesus is: Salvation, Truth, the Good News, Righteousness. Jesus gives believers a new heart by the Holy Spirit'\n\nApplication: |-\n  Jesus saved me and changes my life. I used to be far from God and was his enemy. Believers in Jesus believe that He is God, that He never sinned, that He fulfilled God’s law, that He took my punishment in my place for my disobedience, that He died and rose again, that He forgave my sin and gave me the Holy Spirit and that He loves me. Do I believe in Jesus? When I believe in Him, I love Him. When I love Him, I love other people, especially believers. When I believe in Him, I ask Him, He gives me strength to love Him and others and to resist evil.\n\n  The picture of the armor of God shows me Jesus and my new life in Him.\n\n  The belt of truth: Jesus and His ways are right. When I know Jesus and what pleases Him then that truth acts like a belt that helps my clothes to stay on right. When I know the truth, I won’t listen to the lies of the devil. What truth do I know from the Bible? (for example: Jesus is the Only Saviour and I have spiritual blessings in Jesus Eph 1:3 etc.)\n\n  The breastplate of righteousness: Jesus is my righteousness. I am saved by grace and not by works (Eph 2:8). Knowing that Jesus is my righteousness works like a breastplate that protects my heart from wrong thoughts and pride. I remember that Jesus gave me salvation as a gift.\n\n  Feet ready wearing the gospel of peace: Salvation and forgiveness in Jesus is good news! Jesus is the Saviour of all who believe and He gives us unity and peace in Him! (Eph. 2:17-22). I put on shoes to go somewhere more easily or faster. I want to know the good news about Jesus so I can be ready to share about Jesus and His love and salvation for all!\n\n  The shield of faith: I believe that Jesus saved me and now I am a child of God. When I’m having a hard time, I can with faith boldly ask Jesus to help me and He will protect me like a shield and give me strength from the Holy Spirit to trust Him and know His love (Eph. 3:12, 16-19).\n\n  The helmet of salvation: Jesus changes my thinking and my life. I love Jesus and want to live pleasing to Him. He helps me to put off the old way of life and start to live a new life in Christ. Just like a helmet protects the head, so salvation in Jesus protects my mind and His Spirit renews my thinking and my life (Eph. 4:23-24).\n\n  The sword of the Spirit with is the Word of God: Jesus gave us the Bible, that is, the Word of God. When I believe what is written in the Word, then it works like a sword that protects from falsehood and helps me destroy sin in my life (Eph. 4:30-32).\n\n  __Jesus, please help me to imitate You and as God’s beloved child to live in love as You loved us and gave Yourself for us (Eph. 5:1-2). Please fill me with the Holy Spirit, to love and respect other believers (Eph. 5:18-21). Please help me to stand in God’s power against the devil (Eph. 6:10). Jesus, help me and other believers to boldly share about Your salvation and love! (Eph. 6:18-20).__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

What can man do to me?” or repeat Ps. 96:3 “Declare His glory among the\n  nations, His wonders among all peoples.”'\nSummary: |\n  Paul went to Jerusalem and was arrested there for his faith in Jesus. God gave him an opportunity to share about salvation in Jesus with many kinds and leaders during the time when he was imprisoned and waited for the decision about his court case. Paul was a Roman citizen and had a right to speak with the Roman king (Caesar) about his case. The governor allowed this and sent him to Caesar. (Acts 25:12)\n  Paul (a prisoner for his faith in Jesus) sailed on the ship with other prisoners. Some of Paul’s friends sailed with him. Paul knew that the weather was bad for travelling but the captain decided to sail. They ended up in a storm that lasted for two weeks! God sent His angel to Paul who said, “Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you” (Acts 27:24). Paul believed God’s word and encouraged everyone. There was a shipwreck and all 276 people got to shore on the island of Malta. The Maltese helped them to build a fire. When Paul was helping, a snake bit him and hung on his arm! All the locals thought that this was punishment from God but Paul didn’t get sick from the snake bite. God healed people on the island through Paul.\n  Then they travelled on to Rome. There, Paul lived in a house with soldiers while he waited for his court case. He gathered with Jews and told them about Jesus. Some believed and some didn’t. Paul said that God wants to save the Gentiles too. “Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him, preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him.” (Acts 28:30-31)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is Saviour of all\n- Jesus is always with His own\n- God fulfills His plan\n- God protects\n- Jesus never leaves or forsakes His own\n- Jesus heals\nApplication: |\n  Paul became a prisoner for his faith in Jesus. He saw that God had a plan for him. He didn’t stop talking to people about Jesus even when he was a prisoner. I know that God has a good plan for my life which He wants to fulfill. Wherever I am, I can be sure that Jesus is with me, that He is my help and that nothing can stop God from fulfilling His plan. __Jesus, help me to tell people about Your love and about how You want to forgive their sins and give them new life in You.__\n  Sometimes Paul was in scary situations but Jesus always was with him and helped him to boldly share about Him. Jesus, help me to not be afraid but to trust You and always boldly tell people that You are Saviour. When Paul shared, some people believed in Jesus and some didn’t. When I share about Jesus, some people will believe in Him and some will not. I must simply tell the truth and pray that God would save them. I want to pray for the salvation of ______________ (name).\n  God wants to save everyone from every people group. Paul was Jewish and when he travelled, he began by telling the Jews about Jesus. But he also shared with the Gentiles and many of them believed in Jesus. Maybe it’s easy for me to tell people of my our nationality about Jesus, and maybe it’s hard. Jesus will lead me and show me who to share with and how.\n  __Jesus, You want everyone to know You. In heaven, people from all different nations, tribes and languages will praise You! Thank you that you are always with me. Lead me and use my life so that many people and many nations would love You and worship You! You are worthy!__\n\n  *Teacher! Show the children where the events took place on the map.\n"}</script>

Malachi: The spiritual and moral reconstruction\n  of the nation. Psalms: The aspiration for communion with Christ.'\nScripture: Malachi, Ps. 126\nTruth: Jesus is coming\nVerse: Malachi 3:1”Behold, He is coming,” Says the Lord of hosts.”\nSummary: |+\n  God had brought the people back from captivity, as He promised.”When the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream. Then our mouth was filled with laughter,And our tongue with singing” (Ps 126:1-2).\n  Malachi told the people that God loved them, but that they weren’t loving God. They were not worshipping God with their whole hearts, some of the leaders weren’t being honest, some of the priests weren’t sharing God’s truth with the people and some of the men were not being nice to their wives.  God reminded them that He is a great King and said that,“For from the rising of the sun, even to its going down, My name shall be great among the Gentiles; In every place incense shall be offered to My name, And a pure offering; For My name shall be great among the nations,says the Lord of hosts.” (Malachi 1:11)\n  Malachi shared God’s promises to send a messenger (John the Baptist) who would prepare the way for the Messiah (Jesus), who is also a messenger of the New Covenant (new relationship between God and people). The Messiah will be like fire and soap that cleans and refines people. He will judge people. God calls people to return to Him. He promises to bless them when they live for Him completely and trust Him with all they have.\n  Some people who feared (loved and respected) God made a book of remembrance and wanted to listen to and follow God. God called them His special treasure. God promised to come one day to judge the earth and to save those who love Him: ”But to you who fear My name The Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings” (Mal. 4:2). Again, God promised to send Elijah before He comes to judge the earth.\n\nCharacter:\n- God is Faithful\n- He fulfills His Word\n- He is King\n- Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus heals sin and brokenness\n- Jesus saves those who fear Him\n- He will judge those who don’t love Him\n- Jesus is coming again!\nApplication: |\n  Looking at prophecy can sometimes be like looking at mountains that are far away. At first, it seems like all the peaks are lined up together in the same place. In reality, some of the mountain peaks are closer to us and some are farther away. In Malachi, his words were for the people that heard him speak, but they also are for us now. Some of these words already took place when God sent John the Baptist as the messenger to prepare the way for Jesus to come. Jesus says that John was like the Elijah that Malachi wrote about (Malachi 4:5, Matt 17:11-13) but that Elijah will come again before God judges the earth. These words are like two different mountain peaks. They look like they are in the same place, but they are for different times.\n  Jesus came to bring us the New Covenant. By grace He saves us, through faith in Him. This last book of the Old Testament points to Jesus coming to save all people and bring the message of salvation and of judgement. Jesus saves all who trust in Him. He will judge all who do not trust in Him. Jesus is coming again!\n  Psalm 126 speaks about the people’s joy in returning to Israel: “He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.” (Ps. 126:6). I can share with people that Jesus is Saviour to those who trust Him and that He is Judge to those who do not trust Him. This can be like planting seeds. It is not easy to tell people the truth and sometimes they don’t like what they hear. But after the seeds are planted, God makes it grow and people gather what they planted and are happy. In the same way, God makes His Word bring life to people’s hearts when they believe in Jesus. There is a harvest of people gathered to Jesus. This is very joyful! Lord Jesus, use me to share with people that you are Saviour. You said: “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. __Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.” (Matt 9:37). You are coming soon, Lord Jesus. Help me to love you with all my heart, soul and strength and to share your love and salvation with people.__\n\n  *Malachi prophesied while Nehemiah was governor of Jerusalem.\n  Bible verses with explanation the chronology of Malachi can be found here:\n  http://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/guzik_david/StudyGuide_Mal/Mal_1.cfm\n"}</script>

God Himself will be with them and be their God”  or\n  Rev. 22:20 ““Surely I am coming quickly.” Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!”\nSummary: |\n  in Rev. 21 and 22, Jesus gave John a vision of what will happen in the future. He wrote, “Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea. Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.” Then He who sat on the throne said, “Behold, I make all things new.” And He said to me, “Write, for these words are true and faithful” (Rev. 21:1-5).\n  Jesus said that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. All unbelievers will be in hell, which is a lake of fire. John saw the New Jerusalem, where believers live with Jesus forever. The city is very beautiful. Believers “shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads. There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. And they shall reign forever and ever.” (Rev. 22:4-5) Jesus says several times that He is coming soon! Believers answer that they want Jesus to come and also want people to come to Jesus for new life that He gives as a gift. (Rev. 22:17)\nCharacter:\n- Jesus is King Eternal\n- Jesus is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last\n- Jesus is coming soon! Jesus is Saviour\n- Jesus is the temple (place of worship)\n- Jesus is the Lamb of God\n- Jesus is the Victor\n- Jesus is the Righteous Judge\nApplication: |+\n  God has a great plan of salvation. He wants people to be with Him. Without Jesus, everyone is separated from Him because of sin. But all can receive forgiveness through faith in Jesus. I and everyone that trusts Jesus can be with God forever. This is good news! Do I believe in Jesus? Do I understand the salvation He offers? If I trust Him, then right now Jesus lives in my heart and His Holy Spirit is in me. But one day, Jesus will come and take me to be with Him.\n  He will make a new heaven and new earth. There, I will live with Jesus forever! In that place, there will be no sin, pain or suffering. There in heaven, also called the New Jerusalem, I will see Jesus face to face! I want everyone to be there with Jesus. That’s why I want to tell people about Him. Now, people can be saved by Jesus’ grace through faith in Him. But there will be a time when it will be too late and Jesus will judge those who didn’t believe in Him and punish them in hell.\n  Jesus gives rewards to those to believe in Him.__ Jesus, I don’t want people to go to hell. I want them to be with You in heaven. Save people, Jesus, and help me to tell people about salvation in You and about the hope of heaven, where You will reign. Help me to warn people about hell so they will quickly turn to the Saviour for mercy and forgiveness. Jesus, I am waiting for You! You are coming soon! I will be very glad to see You! You are my King and Saviour! I love you.
